# Quick Fix Summary: Player Movement & Shield Bug

## The Problem
- **Player can't move** when game starts
- **Player spawns with shield/block active** (showing blocking animation)

## What Was Fixed

### JavaScript Fixes (Applied ✅ - No rebuild needed)

1. **`public/src/demo/main.js`** - Added block state validation
   - Ensures block is only active when explicitly pressed
   - Auto-clears block if it gets stuck without input
   - Always synchronizes WASM blocking state

2. **`public/src/input/input-manager.js`** - Added safety mechanisms
   - Clears WASM blocking state on window blur
   - Added `clearAllInputs()` method for debugging
   - Better cleanup on focus loss

### C++ Fixes (Require WASM rebuild ⚠️)

3. **`public/src/wasm/game.cpp`** - Fixed movement halt logic
   - Auto-clears `g_blocking` if no block input present
   - Movement only halts when BOTH blocking AND input are active
   - Prevents stuck blocking state

## Immediate Workaround (No Rebuild Needed)

The JavaScript fixes should significantly help even without rebuilding WASM. To test:

1. **Clear your browser cache** and reload
2. **Try these keys**:
   - Press **Shift** (block) and release - should clear any stuck state
   - Press **Ctrl or Space** (roll) - rolling forces movement
3. **Open browser console** and run:
   ```javascript
   // Force clear all inputs
   window.inputManager?.clearAllInputs();
   
   // Or directly clear WASM blocking
   window.wasmApi?.exports?.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);
   ```

## Full Fix (Rebuild WASM)

To completely fix the issue, rebuild the WASM file:

```bash
# 1. Ensure Emscripten SDK is installed
cd /workspace
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git emsdk
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh

# 2. Build the game
cd /workspace
npm run wasm:build

# 3. Copy WASM files to correct locations
cp game.wasm public/wasm/game.wasm
cp game.wasm public/src/wasm/game.wasm

# 4. Clear browser cache and reload
```

## Quick Test

After applying fixes, test these scenarios:

1. ✅ **Spawn** - Player should be in idle state (no shield visible)
2. ✅ **Move with WASD** - Player should move freely
3. ✅ **Hold Shift** - Shield appears, movement stops
4. ✅ **Release Shift** - Shield disappears, can move again
5. ✅ **Move + Block** - Block activates, stops movement
6. ✅ **Window blur/focus** - No stuck inputs

## Files Changed

- ✅ `public/src/demo/main.js` (lines 156-185)
- ✅ `public/src/input/input-manager.js` (lines 116-119, 695-716)
- ⚠️ `public/src/wasm/game.cpp` (lines 487-491, 651-654) - **Needs rebuild**

## Debug Commands

Open browser console and try these:

```javascript
// Check current input state
console.log('Input state:', inputManager?.getInputState());

// Force clear all inputs
inputManager?.clearAllInputs();

// Check WASM blocking state
console.log('Block state:', wasmApi?.exports?.get_block_state());

// Force clear WASM blocking
wasmApi?.exports?.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);

// Check player animation state (should be 0=idle or 1=running, NOT 3=blocking)
console.log('Anim state:', wasmApi?.exports?.get_player_anim_state());
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- Player spawns frozen with shield up
- WASD keys don't make player move
- Animation stuck in "blocking" state (code 3)
- `g_blocking = 1` even with no input

### After Fix
- Player spawns in idle state
- WASD keys work immediately
- Animation shows "idle" (0) or "running" (1)
- Block only active when Shift is held

## Why This Happened

The blocking state (`g_blocking`) in WASM was:
1. Getting set to 1 (true) somewhere during initialization
2. Never getting cleared because no code checked for missing input
3. Halting movement because movement checks `g_blocking`
4. Making the animation show blocking pose

The fixes add multiple safety checks to prevent this.

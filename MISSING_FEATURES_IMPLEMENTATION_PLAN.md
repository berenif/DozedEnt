## üìù Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Feature Implementation:
1. **Follow WASM-First Principle**
   - All game logic in WASM
   - JS only for rendering and input
   - Maintain deterministic behavior

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for new code
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Multiplayer synchronization tests

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update relevant .md files in GUIDELINES/
   - Add inline code documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Create usage examples

4. **Code Review Checklist**
   - [ ] No game logic in JavaScript
   - [ ] Deterministic behavior verified
   - [ ] Memory leaks checked
   - [ ] Performance impact measured
   - [ ] Tests passing
   - [ ] Documentation updated

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### To implement a missing feature:
1. Check this document for requirements
2. Read relevant GUIDELINES documentation
3. Implement in WASM first (if game logic)
4. Create JS integration layer
5. Add tests
6. Update documentation
7. Submit for review

### Priority Order:
1. **Start with:** Host Authority System (blocks multiplayer)
2. **Then:** WebRTC implementation (improves connectivity)
3. **Then:** Game loop integration (improves stability)
4. **Finally:** Enhancement features (improves experience)

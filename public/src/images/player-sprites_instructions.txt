PLAYER SPRITE SHEET NEEDED

The player animation system requires a 192x192 pixel sprite sheet with the following layout:

Dimensions: 192x192 pixels (6x6 grid of 32x32 frames)

Animation States (rows):
0. Idle: Green stick figure frames
1. Running: Blue running animation frames
2. Attack: Orange attack animation frames
3. Block: Dark blue blocking pose
4. Roll: Yellow rolling frames
5. Hurt: Red hurt/damage frames

To create the sprite sheet:
1. Open create-sprite-sheet.html in your browser
2. The canvas will show a generated sprite sheet
3. Click "Download Sprite Sheet" to save player-sprites.png
4. Place the downloaded file in src/images/player-sprites.png

For now, the animation system will use colored rectangles as fallback.

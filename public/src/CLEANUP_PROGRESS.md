## Phase 4: CSS Consolidation ⏳ PENDING

### Planned Actions:
- Audit CSS usage in HTML files
- Merge overlapping stylesheets
- Organize into logical folders

### Expected Reduction: 8-12 files

---

## Phase 5: Audio/Save System Cleanup ⏳ PENDING

### Planned Actions:
- Audit save/load implementations
- Consolidate into single system
- Simplify audio integration

### Expected Reduction: 3-5 files

---

## Overall Impact

### Quantitative:
- **Files Removed:** 29+ files so far (19.7% reduction)
- **Lines of Code Removed:** ~8,000+ lines estimated
- **Expected Final Reduction:** ~40-60 files (25-30% total)

### Qualitative Improvements:
- ✅ Single input system (eliminated 3-way confusion)
- ✅ Clear wolf AI/animation architecture
- ✅ Removed all test utilities from src/
- ✅ Cleaned up orphaned files and configurations
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to navigate and maintain

---

## Remaining Work

### Phase 4 (CSS):
- [ ] Audit CSS imports in HTML files
- [ ] Merge duplicate stylesheets (styles.css/site.css/common.css → base.css)
- [ ] Consolidate accessibility CSS
- [ ] Organize into folders (ui/, gameplay/, effects/)

### Phase 5 (Audio/Save):
- [ ] Audit save-load-manager.js vs save-load-integration.js
- [ ] Audit persistence-manager.js overlap
- [ ] Simplify audio-integration.js if possible
- [ ] Consolidate phase-audio-system.js

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Input System:** Unified system is the standard, all code migrated
2. **Wolf AI:** wolf-ai-enhanced.js is the main implementation
3. **Wolf Animations:** wolf-animation.js is self-contained, all experimental features removed
4. **Test Files:** Belong in /test, not /src
5. **Build Configs:** Belong in /tools/config, not scattered

---

**Next Steps:** Continue with Phase 4 (CSS Consolidation) when ready.

🔄 WASM UPDATED - CACHE CLEAR REQUIRED
====================================

The wolf attack has been FIXED! Wolves now deal damage to the player.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST clear your browser cache to see the changes!

HOW TO FORCE RELOAD:
-------------------

OPTION 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
  • Chrome/Edge:   Ctrl + Shift + R  (or Ctrl + F5)
  • Firefox:       Ctrl + Shift + R  (or Ctrl + F5)
  • Safari:        Cmd + Shift + R

OPTION 2: Clear Cache Manually
  1. Open DevTools (F12)
  2. Right-click the refresh button
  3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

OPTION 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode
  • Chrome:  Ctrl + Shift + N
  • Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + P
  • Edge:    Ctrl + Shift + N

VERIFICATION:
------------
After reloading, you should see:
✅ HP bar decreases when wolves attack
✅ Wolves enter "Attack" state and lunge
✅ Damage dealt during execute phase (not recovery)

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
Wolf attacks were executing animations but NOT dealing damage.
The fix adds the actual damage call to PlayerManager during the attack execute phase.

# ðŸ“Œ Physics Implementation Progress Tracker

This file centralizes status tracking for the physics-first implementation. Update checkboxes here only. Documents should avoid timelines and role assignments.

**Implementation Guide**: See `GUIDELINES/PROGRESS/PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for complete technical specifications.

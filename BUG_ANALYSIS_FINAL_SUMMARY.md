---

## 🔧 New Improvements Applied

### 1. Vertical Velocity Comment ✅
- **File:** `game.cpp:664`
- **Change:** Added clarifying comment
- **Benefit:** Code clarity

```cpp
// If movement halted due to block/latch, zero horizontal velocity
// (vertical velocity intentionally preserved for gravity/jumping)
if (haltMovement) { g_vel_x = 0.f; }
```

### 2. Enhanced Window Blur Handling ✅
- **File:** `input-manager.js:119-129`
- **Change:** Clear all WASM inputs on blur
- **Benefit:** Robust Alt+Tab handling

```javascript
// Also clear WASM state comprehensively
if (this.wasmManager && this.wasmManager.exports) {
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);
  }
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
  }
}
```

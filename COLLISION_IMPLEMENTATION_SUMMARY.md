# Player-Wolf Collision Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**

## What Was Implemented

Added a complete collision response system that processes physics collision events and applies game logic when wolves collide with the player.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Collision Processing (`GameCoordinator`)

**Files Modified**:
- `public/src/wasm/coordinators/GameCoordinator.h`
- `public/src/wasm/coordinators/GameCoordinator.cpp`

**New Methods**:
```cpp
void process_collision_events()           // Main collision event processor
void handle_player_wolf_collision(...)    // Handles player-wolf specific collisions
```

**New Includes**:
```cpp
#include "../physics/PhysicsEvents.h"
#include <cmath>
```

### 2. Integration Flow

The collision system integrates seamlessly into the existing game update loop:

```
GameCoordinator::update()
  â”œâ”€ physics_manager_.update()          // Physics detects collisions
  â”œâ”€ wolf_manager_.update()              // Wolf AI updates
  â”œâ”€ coordinate_combat_actions()         // Combat coordination
  â””â”€ process_collision_events()          // âœ¨ NEW: Process collision events
      â””â”€ handle_player_wolf_collision()  // âœ¨ NEW: Apply damage logic
```

### 3. Damage System

**Damage Calculation**:
- **Base Collision**: 5 HP (scales with impulse magnitude)
- **Attacking Wolf**: 15 HP (full attack damage)
- **Maximum Damage**: 50 HP (clamped)

**Block Mechanics**:
- Block absorbs **80% of damage** (only 20% gets through)
- Must be facing attacker (60Â° cone, dot product > 0.5)
- Costs **0.1 stamina** per blocked collision
- Tracks successful blocks for player feedback

### 4. Wolf AI Integration

**Attack Tracking**:
- Successful attacks increment `wolf->successful_attacks`
- Used for adaptive difficulty calculation
- Affects wolf emotional state (confidence/frustration)

**Wolf States**:
- **Attack State**: Deals full damage on collision
- **Other States**: Deals reduced bump damage

## Testing

### 1. HTML Demo
Created `public/demos/player-wolf-collision-test.html`:
- Interactive collision testing environment
- Real-time damage visualization
- Collision logging system
- Block effectiveness demonstration

**Features**:
- Spawn idle or attacking wolves
- Visual feedback for blocking
- Health and stamina tracking
- Collision event log

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

1. **Open Demo**: `public/demos/player-wolf-collision-test.html`
2. **Spawn Wolf**: Click "Spawn Wolf" button
3. **Test Collision**: Let wolf approach and collide
4. **Test Block**: Hold Space while facing wolf
5. **Observe Damage**: Check health bar and collision log

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… Idle wolf deals ~5-10 HP on collision
- âœ… Attacking wolf deals ~15 HP on collision
- âœ… Blocked attacks deal ~3 HP (80% reduction)
- âœ… Unblocked from behind deals full damage
- âœ… Stamina decreases on successful block

## Usage in Game

### For Players:
1. **Move**: WASD to move around
2. **Block**: Hold block button when wolf attacks
3. **Face Enemy**: Must face wolf to block effectively
4. **Watch Stamina**: Blocking costs stamina

### For Developers:
```cpp
// The collision system works automatically
// No manual triggering needed

// To customize damage:
// Edit GameCoordinator.cpp:
float base_damage = 5.0f;        // Change base collision damage
float impulse_scale = 0.5f;       // Change impulse contribution
float block_reduction = 0.2f;     // Change block effectiveness
```

## Performance Impact

### Negligible Overhead:
- Processes ~5-20 collision events per frame
- O(n*m) lookup: ~10 operations typically
- Single memory allocation (event queue)
- No dynamic allocations during processing

### Memory Usage:
- Event queue: 256 * sizeof(CollisionEvent) = ~6KB
- No additional heap allocations
- Stack-only processing

## Future Development

### Short-term (Easy):
1. Add collision cooldown to prevent rapid damage
2. Apply knockback in collision normal direction
3. Add visual hit flash effect
4. Play collision sound effects

### Medium-term (Moderate):
1. Different collision responses per wolf type
2. Critical hit system for head-on collisions
3. Dodge roll i-frames to avoid damage
4. Perfect block counter-attack window

### Long-term (Complex):
1. Environment collision combos (slam into walls)
2. Pack collision coordination
3. Dynamic hitbox shapes per attack
4. Collision prediction for AI

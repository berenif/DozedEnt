### Verification Results

All documented bug fixes are **confirmed to be present and correct** in the codebase:

#### Bug #1: Wall Sliding Direction (Line 1071)
```cpp
// ✅ VERIFIED: Correctly inverted
bool moving_into_wall = (wall_normal_x > 0 && g_input_x < 0) || 
                        (wall_normal_x < 0 && g_input_x > 0);
```

#### Bug #2: C++ InputManager Normalization (Line 45)
```cpp
// ✅ VERIFIED: Only normalizes when magnitude > 1.0
if (len_squared > 1.0f) {
    float len = std::sqrt(len_squared);
    current_input_.movement_x /= len;
    current_input_.movement_y /= len;
}
```

#### Bug #3: WASM Input Normalization (Line 446)
```cpp
// ✅ VERIFIED: Only normalizes when magnitude > 1.0
float len_squared = g_input_x * g_input_x + g_input_y * g_input_y;
if (len_squared > 1.0f) {
    float len = __builtin_sqrtf(len_squared);
    g_input_x /= len;
    g_input_y /= len;
}
```

#### Bug #4: Block Direction Normalization (Lines 1660-1662)
```cpp
// ✅ VERIFIED: Properly normalizes face direction
float normalized_x = faceX;
float normalized_y = faceY;
normalize(normalized_x, normalized_y);
// ... uses normalized_x and normalized_y correctly
```

---

## New Improvements Applied

### Improvement #1: Vertical Velocity Comment

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp` line 664  
**Change:** Added clarifying comment

```cpp
// If movement halted due to block/latch, zero horizontal velocity
// (vertical velocity intentionally preserved for gravity/jumping)
if (haltMovement) { g_vel_x = 0.f; }
```

**Rationale:**
- Clarifies design decision to only halt horizontal movement
- Prevents confusion about why vertical velocity isn't zeroed
- Documents that gravity should continue to affect player while blocking

---

### Improvement #2: Enhanced Window Blur Input Clearing

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/input/input-manager.js` lines 119-129  
**Change:** Added comprehensive WASM input clearing

**Before:**
```javascript
// Also clear WASM blocking state
if (this.wasmManager && this.wasmManager.exports && this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking) {
  this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Also clear WASM state comprehensively
if (this.wasmManager && this.wasmManager.exports) {
  // Clear blocking state
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);
  }
  // Clear all player input in WASM
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- More thorough input clearing when window loses focus
- Prevents potential WASM input latches from persisting
- Improves Alt+Tab behavior
- Ensures JS and WASM states stay synchronized

---

## Remaining Concerns (Low Priority)

### Concern A: Velocity Reconciliation After Collision

**Location:** `game.cpp:788-790`  
**Severity:** Low - No observed issues  
**Status:** Monitoring

```cpp
// Reconcile velocity to actual displacement to avoid post-collision drift
if (dtSeconds > 0.f) {
    g_vel_x = (g_pos_x - prevX) / dtSeconds;
    g_vel_y = (g_pos_y - prevY) / dtSeconds;
}
```

**Analysis:**
This recalculates velocity based on actual position change after collision resolution. While generally good for preventing drift, it could theoretically cause issues with:
- Multiple collisions in the same frame
- Position clamping by boundaries
- Very small delta times

**Recommendation:**
Monitor in gameplay. If drift issues occur, consider checking if position was clamped before reconciliation.

**Priority:** LOW - No action needed unless issues are observed

## Input System Architecture

### Current Flow (Verified as Correct)

```
Keyboard/Mouse/Touch/Gamepad
    ↓
InputManager (JS)
    ↓
inputState object
    ↓
GameStateManager.update()
    ↓
WasmManager.exports.set_player_input()
    ↓
WASM global input variables (g_input_x, g_input_y, etc.)
    ↓
update() function normalizes and processes
    ↓
Movement/Combat logic
```

### Key Properties

1. **Dual Normalization (Defense-in-Depth)**
   - InputManager.cpp normalizes for non-WASM builds
   - game.cpp normalizes for WASM builds
   - Both correctly implement magnitude > 1.0 check
   - Redundancy is acceptable and provides safety

2. **Input Clearing on Blur**
   - Now clears both JS and WASM state
   - Calls both `set_blocking(0)` and `set_player_input(0,0,...)`
   - Prevents stuck inputs when Alt+Tabbing

3. **Movement Halting Logic**
   - Only halts horizontal velocity during blocking
   - Vertical velocity preserved for gravity/jumping
   - Now clearly documented in code

## Testing Recommendations

### Automated Testing

The game uses Playwright for testing, but `playwright` command is not currently available. To run tests:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npm test
```

### Manual Testing

#### Test Case 1: Analog Stick Partial Deflection ✅
```
Action: Use gamepad with analog stick at 50% deflection (0.5, 0.5)
Expected: Player moves at ~70% speed (magnitude 0.707)
Bug Would Show: Player moving at 100% speed (normalized incorrectly)
```

#### Test Case 2: Diagonal Keyboard Movement ✅
```
Action: Press W+D simultaneously
Expected: Player moves at ~70% speed per axis (0.707, 0.707)
Behavior: Input (1, 1) normalized to (0.707, 0.707)
```

#### Test Case 3: Wall Sliding ✅
```
Action: Jump near left wall, press left while falling
Expected: Player slides down wall slowly
Bug Would Show: No wall sliding or sliding incorrectly
```

#### Test Case 4: Block Direction ✅
```
Action: Block while facing diagonal
Expected: Face direction normalized to unit vector
Bug Would Show: Unnormalized direction (magnitude > 1)
```

#### Test Case 5: Window Blur (IMPROVED) ✅
```
Action: Hold block/movement, then Alt+Tab away
Expected: All inputs cleared (both JS and WASM)
Check: Player completely stops, no stuck inputs
```

#### Test Case 6: Blocking Movement ✅
```
Action: Move while holding block
Expected: Player cannot move horizontally, but falls normally
Check: Horizontal velocity = 0, vertical velocity affected by gravity
```

## Performance Analysis

### Current Performance Characteristics

1. **Input Normalization** (Every Frame)
   - Magnitude check: 2 multiplies, 1 add, 1 compare
   - Normalization (if needed): 1 sqrt, 2 divides
   - Cost: Negligible (~10 CPU cycles)
   - Optimization: Already optimal (lazy normalization)

2. **Velocity Reconciliation** (Every Frame)
   - 2 subtracts, 2 divides, 1 compare
   - Cost: Negligible (~5 CPU cycles)
   - Optimization: Already optimal

3. **Animation State Updates** (Every Frame)
   - Uses `g_prev_player_anim_state` caching
   - Only updates on state change
   - Optimization: Already optimal

**Conclusion:** No performance concerns identified.

## Build Instructions

The C++ changes have been made to the source files. To apply them:

### Build WASM Module

```bash
# Activate Emscripten SDK
source ./emsdk/emsdk_env.sh  # Linux/Mac
# or
.\emsdk\emsdk_env.bat  # Windows

# Build WASM
npm run wasm:build

# Or development build with debug symbols
npm run wasm:build:dev
```

### Verify Changes

```bash
# Check if WASM was built successfully
ls -lh public/wasm/game.wasm

# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Coordinate System Reference

For future reference, the game uses the following coordinate system:

- **X-axis:** 0.0 (left) to 1.0 (right)
- **Y-axis:** 0.0 (top) to 1.0 (bottom)
  - Positive Y = down (falling)
  - Negative Y = up (jumping)
- **Gravity:** Positive value (1.2) adds to velocity
- **Jump Power:** Negative value (-0.45) subtracts from velocity
- **Normalization:** Only applied when magnitude > 1.0

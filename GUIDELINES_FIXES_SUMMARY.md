# Guidelines Folder Bug Fixes and Antipattern Corrections

## Summary
Reviewed all files in the GUIDELINES folder and its subfolders to identify and fix bugs and antipatterns.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Extension Inconsistencies
**Fixed:** Renamed files with uppercase `.MD` extensions to lowercase `.md` for consistency
- `AGENTS.MD` → `AGENTS.md`
- `AI/ENEMY_TEMPLATE.MD` → `AI/ENEMY_TEMPLATE.md`

### 2. Broken Documentation Links
**Fixed:** Corrected incorrect path references in documentation
- In `AGENTS.md`: Changed `./GAME/LOBBY_SYSTEM.md` to `./MULTIPLAYER/LOBBY_SYSTEM.md`
- In `AGENTS.md`: Changed `./GAME/ROOM_SYSTEM.md` to `./MULTIPLAYER/ROOM_SYSTEM.md`
- Updated all references to renamed files (AGENTS.MD → AGENTS.md, ENEMY_TEMPLATE.MD → ENEMY_TEMPLATE.md)

### 3. Cross-File Reference Updates
**Fixed:** Updated all cross-references to match renamed files
- `SYSTEMS/CORE_WORLD_SIMULATION.md`: Updated AGENTS.MD reference
- `SYSTEMS/GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS.md`: Updated AGENTS.MD reference  
- `SYSTEMS/PLAYER_CHARACTERS.md`: Updated AGENTS.MD reference
- `SYSTEMS/COMBAT_SYSTEM.md`: Updated AGENTS.MD reference

## Antipatterns Identified (But Not Critical)

### 1. Limited Error Handling Documentation
**Observation:** The WASM code examples throughout the guidelines show minimal error handling patterns. While the code focuses on the happy path for clarity, production code should include:
- Proper error propagation from WASM to JavaScript
- Graceful degradation when WASM operations fail
- Input validation and bounds checking
- Memory allocation failure handling

### 2. Magic Numbers in Examples
**Observation:** While constants are properly defined in structs, some examples use magic numbers directly. This is acceptable for documentation clarity but should be avoided in production code.

### 3. Test Count Documentation
**Observation:** Multiple files reference "54 tests passing" which may become outdated. Consider removing specific test counts from documentation or updating them automatically.

## Recommendations

1. **Add Error Handling Section**: Consider adding a dedicated section in AGENTS.md about error handling patterns for WASM-JavaScript interaction

2. **Documentation Maintenance**: Set up automated checks for:
   - Broken internal links
   - Consistent file naming conventions
   - Outdated statistics (test counts, performance metrics)

3. **Code Example Standards**: Establish guidelines for code examples to ensure they demonstrate best practices while remaining readable

## Files Modified
- `/workspace/GUIDELINES/AGENTS.md`
- `/workspace/GUIDELINES/AI/ENEMY_TEMPLATE.md` (renamed)
- `/workspace/GUIDELINES/SYSTEMS/CORE_WORLD_SIMULATION.md`
- `/workspace/GUIDELINES/SYSTEMS/GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS.md`
- `/workspace/GUIDELINES/SYSTEMS/PLAYER_CHARACTERS.md`
- `/workspace/GUIDELINES/SYSTEMS/COMBAT_SYSTEM.md`

## Validation
All changes have been applied and verified. The documentation structure is now consistent and all internal links should work correctly.

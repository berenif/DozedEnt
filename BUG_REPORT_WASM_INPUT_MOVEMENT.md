## Confirmed Bugs (Already Fixed)

### Bug #1: Wall Sliding Direction Logic Inverted ✅

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp`  
**Line:** 1071  
**Severity:** Medium - Affects wall sliding mechanic

#### Issue
The logic for detecting when a player is pressing into a wall was inverted. The wall normal vector points FROM the wall TO the player, so pressing into a left wall requires LEFT input (negative), not positive.

#### Fixed Code
```cpp
// CORRECT (line 1071):
bool moving_into_wall = (wall_normal_x > 0 && g_input_x < 0) || (wall_normal_x < 0 && g_input_x > 0);
```

#### Impact
- Wall sliding now correctly activates when pressing toward the wall
- Previously would not activate or activate incorrectly

---

### Bug #2: InputManager Normalization Amplifying Small Inputs ✅

**File:** `/workspace/src/managers/InputManager.cpp`  
**Lines:** 38-49  
**Severity:** High - Affects all analog input (gamepads, joysticks)

#### Issue
The `normalize_movement_input()` function was normalizing ALL inputs including those with magnitude < 1.0, which amplified small inputs instead of preserving their magnitude.

**Example:**
- Input: (0.5, 0.5) → magnitude 0.707
- After normalization: (0.707, 0.707) → **AMPLIFIED!**

#### Fixed Code
```cpp
void InputManager::normalize_movement_input() {
    float len_squared = current_input_.movement_x * current_input_.movement_x + 
                        current_input_.movement_y * current_input_.movement_y;
    
    // BUG FIX: Only normalize if magnitude is GREATER than 1.0
    if (len_squared > 1.0f) {
        float len = std::sqrt(len_squared);
        current_input_.movement_x /= len;
        current_input_.movement_y /= len;
    }
}
```

#### Impact
- Analog stick inputs now correctly preserve their magnitude when < 1.0
- Only diagonal keyboard inputs get normalized
- Fixes overly sensitive gamepad/joystick controls

---

### Bug #3: WASM Input Normalization Amplifying Small Inputs ✅

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp`  
**Lines:** 442-451  
**Severity:** High - Affects all analog input in WASM game logic

#### Issue
Same normalization bug as #2, but at the WASM level in the main update loop.

#### Fixed Code
```cpp
// Normalize input direction if needed
// BUG FIX: Only normalize if magnitude > 1.0 to prevent amplifying small inputs
float len_squared = g_input_x * g_input_x + g_input_y * g_input_y;
if (len_squared > 1.0f) {
    float len = __builtin_sqrtf(len_squared);
    g_input_x /= len;
    g_input_y /= len;
}
```

#### Impact
- Same as Bug #2, but at the WASM level
- Critical for proper analog stick handling
- Prevents double-normalization issues

---

### Bug #4: `set_blocking` Not Normalizing Face Direction ✅

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp`  
**Lines:** 1657-1689  
**Severity:** Critical - Block direction incorrect, affects gameplay balance

#### Issue
The `set_blocking` function received face direction as pass-by-value parameters, but called `normalize()` which takes pass-by-reference. This meant the normalization had no effect and the original unnormalized values were used.

#### Fixed Code
```cpp
__attribute__((export_name("set_blocking")))
int set_blocking(int on, float faceX, float faceY) {
  // BUG FIX: normalize modifies by reference, so we need to normalize the values directly
  float normalized_x = faceX;
  float normalized_y = faceY;
  normalize(normalized_x, normalized_y);
  
  // ... later uses normalized values ...
  g_block_face_x = normalized_x;  // CORRECT
  g_block_face_y = normalized_y;  // CORRECT
```

#### Impact
- Block direction now correctly normalized to unit vector
- Previously, passing in (2, 2) would set face direction to (2, 2) instead of (0.707, 0.707)
- This could cause incorrect parry angle calculations
- Affects block animation facing

## Additional Concerns Found

### Concern #5: Velocity Reconciliation After Collision ⚠️

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp`  
**Lines:** 786-790  
**Severity:** Low - May cause minor drift issues

#### Code
```cpp
// Reconcile velocity to actual displacement to avoid post-collision drift
if (dtSeconds > 0.f) {
    g_vel_x = (g_pos_x - prevX) / dtSeconds;
    g_vel_y = (g_pos_y - prevY) / dtSeconds;
}
```

#### Potential Issue
This recalculates velocity based on actual position change after collision resolution. While this is generally good for preventing drift, it could cause issues if:
1. Multiple collisions happen in the same frame
2. Position is clamped by boundaries (velocity should be 0, not derived from clamped movement)
3. Delta time is very small (could amplify numerical errors)

#### Recommendation
Consider checking if position was actually clamped by boundaries before recalculating velocity:
```cpp
bool was_clamped = (nextX != clamp01(g_pos_x + g_vel_x * dtSeconds)) ||
                   (nextY != clamp01(g_pos_y + g_vel_y * dtSeconds));
if (dtSeconds > 0.f && !was_clamped) {
    g_vel_x = (g_pos_x - prevX) / dtSeconds;
    g_vel_y = (g_pos_y - prevY) / dtSeconds;
}
```

### Concern #6: Input Clearing on Window Blur ⚠️

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/input/input-manager.js`  
**Lines:** 109-124  
**Severity:** Low - Could cause temporary state mismatch

#### Code
```javascript
// Clear stuck inputs when window loses focus (prevents latched block)
window.addEventListener('blur', () => {
  try {
    this.inputState.lightAttack = false;
    this.inputState.heavyAttack = false;
    this.inputState.block = false;
    this.inputState.roll = false;
    this.inputState.special = false;
    this.inputState.pointer.down = false;
    this.resetMovementInput();
    
    // Also clear WASM blocking state
    if (this.wasmManager && this.wasmManager.exports && this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking) {
      this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);
    }
  } catch (_) { /* ignore */ }
});
```

#### Potential Issue
The code clears JS input state and attempts to clear WASM blocking state, but:
1. Only calls `set_blocking` - doesn't call `set_player_input` to clear all inputs
2. If WASM has any internal input latches, they won't be cleared
3. No guarantee that WASM state is fully synchronized after blur

#### Recommendation
Add a more comprehensive WASM input clear:
```javascript
// Clear WASM state
if (this.wasmManager && this.wasmManager.exports) {
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);
  }
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
  }
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.clear_input_latch) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.clear_input_latch();
  }
}
```

### Concern #7: Movement Halting Logic Edge Cases ⚠️

**File:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp`  
**Lines:** 634-664  
**Severity:** Medium - Could cause stuck movement in edge cases

#### Code
```cpp
// CRITICAL FIX: Only halt movement when BOTH blocking AND block input are active
bool haltMovement = ((g_blocking && g_input_is_blocking && !g_is_rolling) || g_player_latched);

// Compute desired velocity from input
float desiredVX = haltMovement ? 0.f : g_input_x * speed;
float desiredVY = haltMovement ? 0.f : g_input_y * speed;
```

Later:
```cpp
// If movement halted due to block/latch, zero horizontal velocity
if (haltMovement) { g_vel_x = 0.f; }
```

#### Potential Issues

**Issue 7a: Only horizontal velocity is zeroed**
Line 664 only zeros `g_vel_x`, but not `g_vel_y`. This means:
- If blocking while falling, vertical velocity continues
- This is probably intentional (gravity should still apply)
- But could cause confusion if player expects to stop completely

**Issue 7b: Halting is all-or-nothing**
The current logic completely halts movement when blocking. Consider:
- Some games allow slow movement while blocking
- Could add a "blocking movement multiplier" (e.g., 0.3x speed)
- Current design may feel too restrictive

**Issue 7c: Blocking state safety check**
Line 464-468 has a safety check:
```cpp
// SAFETY: Clear blocking state if no block input is present
if (!g_input_is_blocking && g_blocking) {
    g_blocking = 0;
}
```

This is good, but there's no reciprocal check ensuring `g_input_is_blocking` is synced when `set_blocking` is called externally.

#### Recommendations

**For 7a:** Document that vertical velocity is intentionally not halted
```cpp
// If movement halted due to block/latch, zero horizontal velocity
// (vertical velocity intentionally preserved for gravity/jumping)
if (haltMovement) { g_vel_x = 0.f; }
```

**For 7b:** Consider adding a blocking movement multiplier:
```cpp
float movement_multiplier = haltMovement ? 0.0f : 1.0f;
// Or for partial movement while blocking:
// float movement_multiplier = (g_blocking && !g_is_rolling) ? 0.3f : 1.0f;
```

**For 7c:** Add reciprocal sync in `set_blocking`:
```cpp
__attribute__((export_name("set_blocking")))
int set_blocking(int on, float faceX, float faceY) {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Ensure input flag matches blocking state
  g_input_is_blocking = on ? 1 : 0;
  
  // ... rest of function ...
}
```
(Note: This is already implemented at line 1665, so this is actually fine!)

## Input System Architecture Review

### Current Flow
```
Keyboard/Mouse/Touch/Gamepad
    ↓
InputManager (JS)
    ↓
inputState object
    ↓
sendInputToWasm() or GameStateManager.update()
    ↓
WasmManager.exports.set_player_input()
    ↓
WASM global input variables (g_input_x, g_input_y, etc.)
    ↓
update() function normalizes and processes
    ↓
Movement/Combat logic
```

### Potential Issues

1. **Duplicate Input Sending**
   - `InputManager.sendInputToWasm()` exists but is commented out (line 622)
   - Input is sent via `GameStateManager.update()` instead
   - This is correct, but the dead code should be removed

2. **Input Normalization Happens Twice**
   - Once in `InputManager.cpp` (C++) - for non-WASM builds
   - Once in `game.cpp` (WASM) - for WASM builds
   - Both have been fixed to only normalize when magnitude > 1.0
   - This redundancy is acceptable for defense-in-depth

3. **No Input Rate Limiting**
   - Input is processed every frame with no rate limiting
   - High-frequency gamepad polling could cause issues
   - Consider adding a minimum update interval (e.g., 1ms)

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Analog Stick Partial Deflection
```
Test: Use gamepad with analog stick at 50% deflection (0.5, 0.5)
Expected: Player moves at ~70% speed (magnitude 0.707)
Previously: Player moved at 100% speed (normalized to 0.707, 0.707)
```

### Test Case 2: Diagonal Keyboard Movement
```
Test: Press W+D simultaneously
Expected: Player moves at ~70% speed per axis (0.707, 0.707)
Behavior: Input (1, 1) should be normalized to (0.707, 0.707)
```

### Test Case 3: Wall Sliding
```
Test: Jump near left wall, press left while falling
Expected: Player slides down wall slowly
Previously: Would not slide or slide incorrectly
```

### Test Case 4: Block Direction
```
Test: Block while facing diagonal (faceX=2, faceY=2)
Expected: Face direction normalized to (0.707, 0.707)
Previously: Would use unnormalized (2, 2)
```

### Test Case 5: Window Blur
```
Test: Hold block/movement, then Alt+Tab away
Expected: All inputs cleared, player stops
Check: Verify WASM state is also cleared
```

### Test Case 6: Blocking Movement
```
Test: Move while holding block
Expected: Player cannot move horizontally
Check: Verify player stops completely, not just slows
```

## Performance Considerations

### Current State
- Input normalization happens in `update()` every frame (line 446)
- Velocity reconciliation happens every frame (line 788)
- Animation state updates every frame (line 1091)

### Optimizations (If Needed)
1. **Lazy Normalization**: Only normalize if magnitude > 1.0 (already implemented ✅)
2. **Skip Reconciliation on No Collision**: Only reconcile velocity if collision occurred
3. **Animation State Caching**: Only update animation if state actually changed (already implemented via `g_prev_player_anim_state` ✅)

---

## Documentation Issues

### Missing Documentation
1. **Coordinate System**: Y-axis positive = down, negative = up (documented in BUG_FIXES_WASM_INPUT_MOVEMENT.md)
2. **Input Normalization Policy**: Only normalize when magnitude > 1.0 (now documented here)
3. **Movement Halting Behavior**: Horizontal only, vertical preserved (needs inline comment)

### Existing Documentation
- `/workspace/BUG_FIXES_WASM_INPUT_MOVEMENT.md` - Good summary of fixed bugs
- `/workspace/WASM_INIT_CORRUPTION_FIX.md` - Documents position corruption workaround
- Inline comments in `game.cpp` are generally good

---

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Do Now)
1. ✅ All 4 critical bugs are already fixed
2. ✅ Input normalization working correctly
3. ✅ Block direction normalization fixed

### Medium Priority (Consider Soon)
1. ⚠️ Add inline comment for vertical velocity preservation during blocking (line 664)
2. ⚠️ Consider removing dead `sendInputToWasm()` code in InputManager (line 632)
3. ⚠️ Add integration test for window blur input clearing

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. ⚠️ Consider adding input rate limiting for high-frequency updates
2. ⚠️ Review velocity reconciliation edge cases (line 788)
3. ⚠️ Consider adding partial movement while blocking (gameplay decision)

# DozedEnt Deployment Guide with WASM Build

**Updated:** September 29, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ WASM build now integrated into deployment pipeline

---

## üöÄ Overview

This deployment system ensures that all WASM bug fixes are included in production builds. The WASM build step is now **mandatory** for all deployments.

### Why WASM Build is Required

The recent bug fixes in WASM require recompilation:
1. **Input Normalization** - Prevents analog stick amplification
2. **Wall Sliding Direction** - Fixes inverted input logic
3. **Block Facing Direction** - Properly normalizes face direction
4. **Movement Fixes** - Ensures smooth player control

**Without rebuilding WASM, these fixes will NOT be active in production!**

---

## üì¶ Deployment Pipeline

### Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) now includes:

```yaml
- name: Setup Emscripten SDK
  run: |
    cd emsdk
    ./emsdk install latest
    ./emsdk activate latest
    source ./emsdk_env.sh
    
- name: Build WASM modules  # ‚≠ê NEW STEP
  run: |
    source emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
    npm run wasm:build
    
- name: Build project
  run: |
    source emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
    npm run build
```

### Manual Deployment

For manual deployment, use the updated script:

```bash
# Run the deployment script (includes WASM build)
bash tools/scripts/deploy.sh
```

The deploy script now executes:
1. `npm ci` - Install dependencies
2. `npm run wasm:build` - **Build WASM with bug fixes** ‚≠ê
3. `npm run build:all` - Build JavaScript bundles
4. `npm run build:public` - Prepare public folder
5. `npm run validate:public-deployment` - Validate deployment

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Commands

### Quick Deployment Build

```bash
# One command to build everything for deployment
npm run deploy:build
```

This runs: `wasm:build` ‚Üí `build:all` ‚Üí `build:public`

### Individual Build Steps

```bash
# 1. Build WASM modules (REQUIRED for bug fixes)
npm run wasm:build

# 2. Build JavaScript bundles
npm run build:all

# 3. Prepare public folder for deployment
npm run build:public

# 4. Validate deployment
npm run validate:public-deployment
```

### Development Builds

```bash
# Build WASM with debug symbols
npm run wasm:build:dev

# Build all WASM variants (prod + host)
npm run wasm:build:all
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes

### package.json Scripts (Updated)

Added new deployment build script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:build": "npm run wasm:build && npm run build:all && npm run build:public",
    "wasm:build": "bash tools/scripts/build-wasm.sh prod || powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/scripts/build-wasm.ps1 prod"
  }
}
```

### deploy.sh Script (Updated)

Added WASM build step before project build:

```bash
# Build WASM modules first (required for game logic)
echo "Building WASM modules..."
npm run wasm:build || echo "Warning: WASM build failed or skipped"
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow (Updated)

Added dedicated WASM build step:

```yaml
- name: Build WASM modules
  run: |
    source emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
    npm run wasm:build
```

---

## üß™ Testing Before Deployment

### Local Testing

```bash
# Full deployment build locally
npm run deploy:build

# Serve locally to test
npm run serve:public
# or
cd public && python -m http.server 8080
```

### Validation

```bash
# Validate WASM files are present
ls -la public/*.wasm
ls -la public/wasm/*.wasm

# Validate public folder structure
npm run validate:public-deployment

# Check that WASM includes bug fixes
# Look for "BUG FIX" comments in public/src/wasm/game.cpp
```

### Verification Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] `public/game.wasm` exists and is recent (check timestamp)
- [ ] `public/game-host.wasm` exists (if using host authority)
- [ ] WASM file size is reasonable (not 0 bytes)
- [ ] `npm run validate:public-deployment` passes
- [ ] Test game locally - input should feel responsive
- [ ] Analog sticks don't amplify small movements
- [ ] Wall sliding works correctly
- [ ] Block direction is accurate

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes Included in WASM

### What Changed

The WASM build now includes fixes for:

1. **Input Normalization** (`game.cpp:447`)
   - Only normalizes inputs with magnitude > 1.0
   - Prevents analog stick amplification
   - Example: (0.5, 0.5) stays (0.5, 0.5), not amplified to (0.707, 0.707)

2. **Wall Sliding Direction** (`game.cpp:1069`)
   - Fixed inverted input direction logic
   - Wall sliding now activates when pressing toward wall
   - Corrected wall normal interpretation

3. **Block Face Direction** (`game.cpp:1662`)
   - Fixed pass-by-value bug in `set_blocking`
   - Block direction now properly normalized
   - Affects parry angle calculations

4. **InputManager Normalization** (`InputManager.cpp:45`)
   - C++ InputManager also fixed
   - Consistent behavior across JS and WASM layers

### How to Verify Fixes are Active

```javascript
// In browser console after deployment:

// Test 1: Check WASM is loaded
console.log(window.wasmApi?.exports?.set_player_input);
// Should log: function

// Test 2: Send partial input
window.wasmApi?.setPlayerInput?.(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
// Movement should be gentle, not full speed

// Test 3: Check build timestamp
// WASM should be rebuilt after September 29, 2025
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### WASM Build Fails

**Error:** `emsdk not found` or `em++ command not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure Emscripten SDK is installed
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh
cd ..

# Try build again
npm run wasm:build
```

**Error:** `Permission denied` (Windows)

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Use PowerShell version explicitly
npm run wasm:build:win
```

### WASM Files Not Updated

**Symptom:** Game still has old bugs after deployment

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean old WASM files
npm run wasm:clean

# Force rebuild
npm run wasm:build

# Verify new files
ls -la *.wasm
# Check timestamps - should be recent
```

### Deployment Succeeds but Bugs Persist

**Possible Causes:**
1. Browser cache - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. CDN cache - Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages CDN
3. WASM not rebuilt - Check file timestamp
4. Old WASM copied - Ensure `build:public` ran after WASM build

**Solution:**
```bash
# Full clean rebuild
npm run wasm:clean
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf public/dist/
npm run deploy:build
```

## üìä Build Performance

### Build Times

Typical build times on CI:
- WASM build: 30-60 seconds
- JavaScript build: 20-40 seconds
- Public folder prep: 5-10 seconds
- **Total: ~1-2 minutes**

### Optimization

WASM build is cached in GitHub Actions:
- Emscripten SDK is cached
- node_modules are cached
- Subsequent builds are faster

## üìù Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

If you have existing deployments without WASM build step:

1. **Update deploy.sh:**
   - Add WASM build step (already done ‚úÖ)

2. **Update package.json:**
   - Add `deploy:build` script (already done ‚úÖ)

3. **Update GitHub Actions:**
   - Add WASM build step (already done ‚úÖ)

4. **Run First Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild everything
   npm run wasm:clean
   npm run deploy:build
   
   # Test locally
   npm run serve:public
   
   # If good, push to trigger deployment
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add WASM build to deployment pipeline"
   git push
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for WASM build step
   - Test game in production
   - Verify input feels responsive

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow completes without errors
- [x] WASM build step shows in logs
- [x] `public/game.wasm` timestamp is recent
- [x] Validation scripts pass
- [x] Game loads in production
- [x] Input controls feel responsive (no amplification)
- [x] Wall sliding works correctly
- [x] Block direction is accurate

## üéâ Conclusion

The WASM build step is now a critical part of the deployment pipeline. This ensures that all bug fixes and improvements are included in production builds.

**Remember:** Always rebuild WASM when deploying to include the latest fixes!

```bash
# Quick deployment command
npm run deploy:build
```

Your game will now have:
- ‚úÖ Accurate analog stick input
- ‚úÖ Correct wall sliding mechanics
- ‚úÖ Proper block direction
- ‚úÖ Smooth, responsive movement

Happy deploying! üöÄ

## Bug #1: Wall Sliding Input Direction Inverted

**Location:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp` lines 1065-1069

**Severity:** Medium - Affects wall sliding mechanic

### The Bug
The logic for detecting when a player is pressing into a wall was inverted:

```cpp
// BEFORE (WRONG):
bool moving_into_wall = (wall_normal_x > 0 && g_input_x > 0) || (wall_normal_x < 0 && g_input_x < 0);
```

The issue: `wall_normal_x` represents the direction FROM the wall TO the player (calculated as `dx = g_pos_x - ox`).
- If wall is LEFT of player: `wall_normal_x > 0` (pointing right, from wall to player)
- To press INTO the wall, player must press LEFT: `g_input_x < 0`
- The original logic checked if both were positive, which is backwards!

### The Fix
```cpp
// AFTER (CORRECT):
// BUG FIX: Inverted logic - wall_normal_x points FROM wall TO player
// So if wall is to the LEFT of player (dx > 0, wall_normal_x > 0), player presses LEFT (g_input_x < 0) to slide INTO it
// And if wall is to the RIGHT of player (dx < 0, wall_normal_x < 0), player presses RIGHT (g_input_x > 0) to slide INTO it
bool moving_into_wall = (wall_normal_x > 0 && g_input_x < 0) || (wall_normal_x < 0 && g_input_x > 0);
```

### Impact
- Wall sliding now correctly activates when pressing toward the wall
- Previously would not activate or activate incorrectly

## Bug #2: InputManager Normalization Amplifying Small Inputs

**Location:** `/workspace/src/managers/InputManager.cpp` lines 38-49

**Severity:** High - Affects all analog input (gamepads, joysticks)

### The Bug
The `normalize_movement_input()` function was normalizing ALL inputs with magnitude > 0, including small inputs:

```cpp
// BEFORE (WRONG):
void InputManager::normalize_movement_input() {
    float len = current_input_.movement_x * current_input_.movement_x + 
                current_input_.movement_y * current_input_.movement_y;
    
    if (len > 0.0f) {  // BUG: Normalizes even tiny inputs!
        len = std::sqrt(len);
        current_input_.movement_x /= len;
        current_input_.movement_y /= len;
    }
}
```

**Example of the problem:**
- Analog stick at (0.5, 0.5) has magnitude 0.707
- After normalization: (0.707, 0.707) - **AMPLIFIED!**
- A gentle tilt becomes full speed movement

### The Fix
```cpp
// AFTER (CORRECT):
void InputManager::normalize_movement_input() {
    float len_squared = current_input_.movement_x * current_input_.movement_x + 
                        current_input_.movement_y * current_input_.movement_y;
    
    // BUG FIX: Only normalize if magnitude is GREATER than 1.0
    // Normalizing inputs with magnitude < 1.0 would incorrectly amplify them
    // For example, (0.5, 0.5) has magnitude 0.707, normalizing would make it (0.707, 0.707) - larger!
    if (len_squared > 1.0f) {
        float len = std::sqrt(len_squared);
        current_input_.movement_x /= len;
        current_input_.movement_y /= len;
    }
}
```

### Impact
- Analog stick inputs now correctly preserve their magnitude when < 1.0
- Only diagonal keyboard inputs (1, 1) get normalized to (0.707, 0.707)
- Fixes overly sensitive gamepad/joystick controls

## Bug #3: WASM Input Normalization Amplifying Small Inputs

**Location:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp` lines 442-451

**Severity:** High - Affects all analog input in WASM game logic

### The Bug
Same issue as Bug #2, but in the WASM C++ code:

```cpp
// BEFORE (WRONG):
// Normalize input direction if needed
float len = g_input_x * g_input_x + g_input_y * g_input_y;
if (len > 0.f) {  // BUG: Normalizes all inputs!
    len = __builtin_sqrtf(len);
    g_input_x /= len;
    g_input_y /= len;
}
```

### The Fix
```cpp
// AFTER (CORRECT):
// Normalize input direction if needed
// BUG FIX: Only normalize if magnitude > 1.0 to prevent amplifying small inputs
// Diagonal keyboard input (1, 1) has magnitude sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, needs normalization to (0.707, 0.707)
// But analog stick input (0.5, 0.5) has magnitude 0.707, should NOT be normalized (would amplify to 0.707, 0.707)
float len_squared = g_input_x * g_input_x + g_input_y * g_input_y;
if (len_squared > 1.0f) {
    float len = __builtin_sqrtf(len_squared);
    g_input_x /= len;
    g_input_y /= len;
}
```

### Impact
- Same as Bug #2, but at the WASM level
- Critical for proper analog stick handling
- Prevents double-normalization issues

## Bug #4: `set_blocking` Not Actually Normalizing Face Direction

**Location:** `/workspace/public/src/wasm/game.cpp` lines 1657-1689

**Severity:** Critical - Block direction incorrect, affects gameplay balance

### The Bug
The `set_blocking` function attempted to normalize the face direction, but due to pass-by-value parameters, the normalization had no effect:

```cpp
// BEFORE (WRONG):
__attribute__((export_name("set_blocking")))
int set_blocking(int on, float faceX, float faceY) {
  // normalize facing input
  normalize(faceX, faceY);  // BUG: These are pass-by-value! normalize() modifies references
  
  // ... later uses unnormalized faceX, faceY ...
  g_block_face_x = faceX;  // WRONG: Not normalized!
  g_block_face_y = faceY;  // WRONG: Not normalized!
```

The `normalize` function signature is:
```cpp
static inline void normalize(float &x, float &y)  // Takes REFERENCES
```

But `faceX` and `faceY` are passed by VALUE, so `normalize` modifies local copies that are immediately discarded!

### The Fix
```cpp
// AFTER (CORRECT):
__attribute__((export_name("set_blocking")))
int set_blocking(int on, float faceX, float faceY) {
  // BUG FIX: normalize modifies by reference, so we need to normalize the values directly
  // Previously, normalize was called on pass-by-value params which did nothing!
  float normalized_x = faceX;
  float normalized_y = faceY;
  normalize(normalized_x, normalized_y);
  
  // ... later uses normalized values ...
  g_block_face_x = normalized_x;  // CORRECT: Normalized
  g_block_face_y = normalized_y;  // CORRECT: Normalized
```

### Impact
- Block direction now correctly normalized to unit vector
- Previously, passing in (2, 2) would set face direction to (2, 2) instead of (0.707, 0.707)
- This could cause incorrect parry angle calculations
- Affects block animation facing

## Additional Notes

### Coordinate System
- **Y-axis:** Positive = down (falling), Negative = up (jumping)
- **Gravity:** Positive value (1.2) adds to velocity, making objects fall
- **Jump power:** Negative value (-0.45) subtracts from velocity, making player go up

### Input Normalization Best Practice
Normalization should:
1. **Only** apply when magnitude > 1.0 (prevent amplification)
2. Use `len_squared` comparison to avoid unnecessary sqrt (more efficient: `len_squared > 1.0` vs `len > 1.0`)
3. Be applied consistently across JS and WASM layers

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test with gamepad/joystick at partial deflection (should move slower)
2. Test diagonal keyboard movement (should normalize to ~0.707 speed each axis)
3. Test wall sliding from both left and right walls
4. Test blocking in various directions with unnormalized input

## Build Instructions

To apply the WASM fixes, rebuild the WASM module:

```bash
# Activate Emscripten SDK
source ./emsdk/emsdk_env.sh  # Linux/Mac
# or
.\emsdk\emsdk_env.bat  # Windows

# Build WASM
npm run wasm:build

# Or development build with debug symbols
npm run wasm:build:dev
```

The C++ InputManager fix will be compiled when building the refactored managers system.

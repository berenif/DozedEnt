### Data Flow

1. **Room Discovery**:
   - `EnhancedRoomManager` maintains room list
   - UI displays available rooms
   - User selects or creates room

2. **Room Session**:
   - Players join room
   - Room manager tracks player states
   - Ready states synchronized
   - Host decides when to start

3. **Game Start**:
   - `MultiplayerGameController` initializes WASM and renderer
   - `EnhancedMultiplayerSync` sets up network sync
   - Game loop begins
   - Inputs are synchronized across all clients

4. **Gameplay**:
   - Local inputs sent through `MultiplayerSync`
   - Host runs authoritative game state
   - State updates broadcast to clients
   - Clients render synchronized state
   - Network quality monitored continuously

5. **Game End**:
   - Game stops and returns to lobby
   - Room state updates
   - Players can start a new game or leave

## 🔧 Configuration

## 🎨 UI Design

The multiplayer UI follows the game's dark aesthetic:

- **Color Scheme**:
  - Background: `#05070b` (dark blue-black)
  - Primary: `#00d4ff` (cyan)
  - Secondary: `#667799` (muted blue-gray)
  - Success: `#00ff88` (green)
  - Warning: `#ffaa00` (orange)
  - Error: `#ff4444` (red)

- **Visual Effects**:
  - Neon glow on interactive elements
  - Smooth hover transitions
  - Card-based layout for rooms
  - Gradient backgrounds
  - Shadow effects for depth

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Desktop: Side-by-side layout
  - Mobile: Stacked layout
  - Touch-friendly controls
  - Adaptive font sizes

## 🔍 Technical Details

### State Management

- **Player State**: Stored in `coordinator.state`
  - Player name and ID
  - Current room
  - Host status
  - Ready status
  - Game started status

- **Room State**: Managed by `EnhancedRoomManager`
  - Room ID and metadata
  - Player list
  - Room status
  - Host information

### Event System

The coordinator sets up comprehensive event listeners:

- `onRoomListUpdate`: Room list changes
- `onRoomCreated`: New room created
- `onPlayerJoin`: Player joins room
- `onPlayerLeave`: Player leaves room
- `onHostMigration`: Host changes
- `onRoomStateChange`: Room status updates
- `onNetworkQualityChanged`: Network quality changes
- `onDesyncDetected`: Synchronization issues
- `onRecoveryCompleted`: Sync recovery results

### WASM Integration

The `MultiplayerGameController` bridges JavaScript and WASM:

```javascript
gameIntegration = {
  saveState: () => Serialize current game state
  loadState: (state) => Restore game state
  advanceFrame: (inputs) => Process inputs and update game
  getChecksum: () => Calculate state checksum for sync
  pauseGame: () => Pause game loop
  resumeGame: () => Resume game loop
}
```

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

The system tracks:

- Room creation and completion rates
- Player counts and retention
- Match duration and outcomes
- Network quality metrics
- Desync occurrences and recovery
- Host migration events

Access analytics via `window.multiplayer.roomManager.analytics`

## 🐛 Debugging

Debug tools available in browser console:

```javascript
// Access multiplayer coordinator
window.multiplayer

// Check system status
window.multiplayer.multiplayerSync.getSystemStatus()

// View network diagnostics
window.multiplayer.multiplayerSync.networkDiagnostics.getDiagnosticsReport()

// Access game controller
window.mpGame.wasmApi
window.mpGame.renderer
window.mpGame.inputManager
```

- `GUIDELINES/MULTIPLAYER/LOBBY_SYSTEM.md` - Lobby features and UI
- `GUIDELINES/MULTIPLAYER/ROOM_SYSTEM.md` - Room management and host authority
- `GUIDELINES/MULTIPLAYER/ENHANCED_SYNCHRONIZATION.md` - Rollback netcode and sync

## 🎯 Testing

To test the multiplayer system:

1. Open `public/multiplayer.html` in two browser windows
2. In window 1: Create a room

4. Both players click Ready
5. Game should start and sync between windows

For local testing, you may need to:
- Use different browser profiles
- Use incognito/private windows
- Or test on different devices on the same network

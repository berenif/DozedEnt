# Bug Analysis Summary - WASM, Input, and Player Movement

**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Analysis Type:** Code Review and Bug Hunt  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Quick Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the WASM game logic, input handling, and player movement systems. Here's what I found:

### ‚úÖ Good News: Critical Bugs Already Fixed

All major bugs have been previously identified and fixed:

1. **Wall Sliding Input Direction Inverted** - Fixed in `game.cpp:1071`
2. **Input Normalization Amplifying Small Inputs** - Fixed in both `InputManager.cpp:45` and `game.cpp:446`
3. **Block Direction Not Normalizing** - Fixed in `game.cpp:1660-1662`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Concerns Identified

Three minor issues that don't significantly impact gameplay:

1. **Velocity reconciliation** after collision (low priority)
2. **Input clearing on window blur** could be more thorough (low priority)
3. **Movement halting logic** vertical velocity comment needed (documentation)

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Input Normalization (FIXED ‚úÖ)

**What It Was:**
Analog stick inputs were being normalized even when their magnitude was less than 1.0, effectively amplifying gentle stick movements to full speed.

**Example:**
- Gentle push: (0.5, 0.5) ‚Üí magnitude 0.707
- After bug: Normalized to (0.707, 0.707) ‚Üí **amplified!**
- After fix: Stays (0.5, 0.5) ‚Üí **correct!**

**Where Fixed:**
- `InputManager.cpp` line 45: Only normalizes if `len_squared > 1.0f`
- `game.cpp` line 446: Same fix in WASM code

**Impact:**
- Gamepad/joystick controls now have proper analog sensitivity
- Gentle movements are gentle, hard movements are fast
- Diagonal keyboard inputs still normalized correctly

---

### 2. Wall Sliding Direction (FIXED ‚úÖ)

**What It Was:**
The logic for detecting when a player presses INTO a wall was inverted. The `wall_normal_x` vector points FROM the wall TO the player, so pressing into a left wall requires pressing LEFT (negative input), not right.

**Where Fixed:**
- `game.cpp` line 1071

**Before:**
```cpp
bool moving_into_wall = (wall_normal_x > 0 && g_input_x > 0) || 
                        (wall_normal_x < 0 && g_input_x < 0);
```

**After:**
```cpp
bool moving_into_wall = (wall_normal_x > 0 && g_input_x < 0) || 
                        (wall_normal_x < 0 && g_input_x > 0);
```

**Impact:**
- Wall sliding now activates correctly when pressing toward walls
- Previously would either not activate or activate at wrong times

---

### 3. Block Direction Normalization (FIXED ‚úÖ)

**What It Was:**
The `set_blocking()` function received face direction as pass-by-value parameters but called `normalize()` which takes pass-by-reference. The normalization had no effect.

**Where Fixed:**
- `game.cpp` lines 1660-1662

**Before:**
```cpp
int set_blocking(int on, float faceX, float faceY) {
  normalize(faceX, faceY);  // Does nothing! Parameters are pass-by-value
  g_block_face_x = faceX;   // Uses unnormalized value!
```

**After:**
```cpp
int set_blocking(int on, float faceX, float faceY) {
  float normalized_x = faceX;
  float normalized_y = faceY;
  normalize(normalized_x, normalized_y);  // Now works!
  g_block_face_x = normalized_x;          // Uses normalized value!
```

**Impact:**
- Block direction now correctly normalized to unit vector
- Parry angle calculations now accurate
- Block animation facing works correctly

---

### 4. Position Corruption (WORKAROUND ‚ö†Ô∏è)

**What It Is:**
Player position was being corrupted immediately after `init_run()` was called, before the game loop even started. The position would end up at (0.94, 0.94) instead of (0.5, 0.5).

**Where Addressed:**
- Workaround in `public/src/demo/main.js` lines 32-43
- Duplicate `init_run()` call removed from `wasm-api.js`

**Root Cause:**
Still unknown - one of the initialization functions in WASM is likely writing to `g_pos_x`/`g_pos_y`. Suspects:
- `physics_init()`
- `force_propagation_init()`
- `chemistry_system_init()`

**Current Status:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Workaround in place (calls `start()` to reset position)
- ‚ùå Root cause not yet fixed in C++
- ‚úÖ Game works with workaround

---

## Minor Concerns (Not Critical)

### Concern A: Velocity Reconciliation

**Location:** `game.cpp:788-790`

**Code:**
```cpp
if (dtSeconds > 0.f) {
    g_vel_x = (g_pos_x - prevX) / dtSeconds;
    g_vel_y = (g_pos_y - prevY) / dtSeconds;
}
```

**Potential Issue:**
Recalculates velocity based on actual position change after collision. Could cause issues with:
- Boundary clamping (velocity should be 0, not derived)
- Very small delta times (numerical errors)
- Multiple collisions in one frame

**Severity:** Low - hasn't caused observable problems

---

### Concern B: Window Blur Input Clearing

**Location:** `input-manager.js:109-124`

**Current Behavior:**
Clears JS input state and calls `set_blocking(0)`, but doesn't call `set_player_input(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)`.

**Potential Issue:**
If WASM has any internal input latches beyond blocking, they won't be cleared when window loses focus.

**Severity:** Low - only affects edge case of Alt+Tab during gameplay

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
if (this.wasmManager && this.wasmManager.exports) {
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_blocking(0, 1, 0);
  }
  if (this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input) {
    this.wasmManager.exports.set_player_input(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
  }
}
```

---

### Concern C: Movement Halting Vertical Velocity

**Location:** `game.cpp:664`

**Code:**
```cpp
// If movement halted due to block/latch, zero horizontal velocity
if (haltMovement) { g_vel_x = 0.f; }
```

**Issue:**
Only zeros horizontal velocity, not vertical. This is probably intentional (gravity should continue), but it's not documented.

**Severity:** Very Low - documentation/clarity issue

**Suggested Fix:**
Add a comment:
```cpp
// If movement halted due to block/latch, zero horizontal velocity
// (vertical velocity intentionally preserved for gravity/jumping)
if (haltMovement) { g_vel_x = 0.f; }
```

   - Effort: 1 minute
   - Benefit: Code clarity

2. **Enhance window blur handling** to clear all inputs
   - Effort: 5 minutes
   - Benefit: More robust Alt+Tab handling

3. **Remove dead code** `sendInputToWasm()` in InputManager (line 632)
   - Effort: 2 minutes
   - Benefit: Code cleanliness

4. **Investigate position corruption root cause** in WASM init
   - Effort: 30-60 minutes
   - Benefit: Remove workaround, cleaner initialization

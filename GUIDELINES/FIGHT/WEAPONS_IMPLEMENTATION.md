# üó°Ô∏è Weapon System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive weapon system for the three character types following the WASM-first architecture principles. Each character now has a unique weapon with distinct stats and special properties.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### üéØ Character Weapons Created

1. **Warden Longsword** - Balanced weapon with shoulder bash synergy
2. **Raider Greataxe** - High damage weapon with hyperarmor
3. **Kensei Katana** - Fast weapon with flow combos and extended reach

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Compliance

- **WASM-First**: All weapon logic implemented in C++ (WebAssembly)
- **Deterministic**: Weapon stats and behavior are consistent across clients
- **Performance Optimized**: Native-speed weapon calculations
- **JavaScript Integration**: JS only handles UI and weapon display

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `src/wasm/weapons.h` - Complete weapon system definition
- `test-weapons.html` - Interactive weapon testing interface
- `WEAPONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

#### Modified Files
- `src/wasm/game.cpp` - Integrated weapon system, updated attack functions
- `src/wasm/wasm-manager.js` - Added weapon-related methods and URL parameter support
- `src/wasm/cashout.h` - Updated shop system to include character weapons

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Weapon Initialization System
```cpp
// Initialize weapon system and set character weapon
init_weapon_system();
set_character_weapon(CharacterType::Warden, WeaponType::WardenLongsword);
```

#### 2. Dynamic Combat Modifiers
- Attack speed modified by weapon speed multiplier
- Stamina costs adjusted by weapon stamina multiplier
- Damage calculations include weapon damage multiplier

#### 3. Special Property System
- Bit-flag based special properties (hyperarmor, flow combo, bash synergy)
- Runtime checks for weapon-specific abilities
- Extensible system for future weapon properties

#### 4. Shop Integration
- Weapons can appear in the CashOut phase shop
- Character-specific weapons available for purchase
- Proper weapon ID assignment in shop generation

### WASM API Extensions

#### New Exports Added
```cpp
// Weapon information
int get_current_weapon()
int get_character_type()
void set_character_and_weapon(int character, int weapon)

// Weapon stats
float get_weapon_damage_mult()
float get_weapon_speed_mult() 
float get_weapon_reach_mult()

// Special properties
int weapon_has_hyperarmor()
int weapon_has_flow_combo()
int weapon_has_bash_synergy()
```

#### JavaScript Integration
```javascript
// Get current weapon info
const weaponInfo = wasmManager.getCurrentWeapon();
const weaponStats = wasmManager.getWeaponStats();

// Set character and weapon
wasmManager.setCharacterAndWeapon(0, 0); // Warden with Longsword
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### URL Parameter Support
```
?weapon=0  # Start with Warden Longsword
?weapon=1  # Start with Raider Greataxe  
?weapon=2  # Start with Kensei Katana
?weapon=3  # Start with Basic Sword
```

### Programmatic Weapon Switching
```javascript
// Initialize WASM with specific weapon
await wasmManager.initialize();
wasmManager.setCharacterAndWeapon(1, 1); // Raider with Greataxe

// Check weapon stats
const stats = wasmManager.getWeaponStats();
console.log(`Damage: ${stats.damage}x, Speed: ${stats.speed}x`);
```

### Combat Integration
The weapon system automatically modifies:
- Attack cooldowns (speed multiplier)
- Stamina costs (cost multiplier)
- Damage output (damage multiplier)
- Special abilities (property flags)

## üß™ Testing

### Test Interface
- Created `test-weapons.html` for interactive weapon testing
- Visual weapon stat display with real-time updates
- Button controls for switching between all weapon types
- Status monitoring and error handling

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Weapon initialization and switching
- ‚úÖ Stat calculation and display
- ‚úÖ Special property detection
- ‚úÖ WASM integration and exports
- ‚úÖ URL parameter handling

## üéØ Character-Weapon Alignment

### Warden (Balanced Pressure)
The Longsword perfectly matches the Warden's balanced approach:
- Standard stats provide reliable performance
- Bash synergy enables mix-up pressure
- Fast recovery supports fundamental gameplay

### Raider (Momentum Bully)  
The Greataxe embodies the Raider's aggressive style:
- High damage rewards successful aggression
- Hyperarmor supports momentum building
- Slower speed requires commitment to attacks

### Kensei (Flow and Reach)
The Katana enables the Kensei's flow-based combat:
- Extended reach supports spacing control
- Faster speed enables fluid combos
- Flow combo system rewards technical play

## üìà Performance Metrics

- **Memory Usage**: Minimal additional memory overhead
- **Computation**: All weapon calculations in native WASM speed
- **Network**: No additional network overhead (deterministic)
- **Determinism**: Fully deterministic across all clients

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
- Additional weapon variants for each character
- Weapon upgrade/enhancement system
- Weapon-specific combo extensions
- Visual weapon effects and animations
- Weapon durability and maintenance

### Integration Opportunities
- Animation system weapon-specific attacks
- Audio system weapon-specific sound effects
- Particle system weapon-specific visual effects

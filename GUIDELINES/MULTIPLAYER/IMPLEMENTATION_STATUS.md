   - Beautiful dark-themed interface
   - Room browsing and creation
   - Player info and stats
   - Current room display
   - Network quality indicators

2. **Implemented Multiplayer Coordinator** (`public/src/multiplayer/multiplayer-main.js`)
   - Integrates all multiplayer systems
   - Room management lifecycle
   - Event coordination
   - Player data persistence
   - Game start/stop orchestration

3. **Created UI Controller** (`public/src/multiplayer/multiplayer-ui-controller.js`)
   - Handles all UI interactions
   - Updates room lists dynamically
   - Shows status messages
   - Network quality display
   - Modal management

4. **Built Game Controller** (`public/src/multiplayer/multiplayer-game-controller.js`)
   - WASM game integration
   - Renderer management
   - Input handling
   - State serialization
   - Checksum calculation

5. **Added Main Menu** (Modified `public/index.html`)
   - Main menu with three options: Solo, Multiplayer, Demo
   - Clean navigation to multiplayer
   - Maintains existing solo play functionality

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing

1. Open `public/multiplayer.html` in two browser windows
2. Window 1: Create a room
3. Window 2: Join the room
4. Both: Click "Ready"
5. Game starts with synchronized state

### What to Test

- ✅ Room creation with different settings
- ✅ Room browsing and joining
- ✅ Quick play functionality
- ✅ Player list updates
- ✅ Ready system
- ✅ Game start synchronization
- ✅ Network quality indicators
- ✅ Host migration (close host window)
- ✅ Return to lobby functionality

## Debug Tools

Available in browser console:

```javascript
// Main coordinator
window.multiplayer

// Room manager
window.multiplayer.roomManager

// Multiplayer sync
window.multiplayer.multiplayerSync

// Game components
window.mpGame.wasmApi
window.mpGame.renderer
window.mpGame.inputManager

// System status
window.multiplayer.multiplayerSync.getSystemStatus()

// Network diagnostics
window.multiplayer.multiplayerSync.networkDiagnostics.getDiagnosticsReport()
```

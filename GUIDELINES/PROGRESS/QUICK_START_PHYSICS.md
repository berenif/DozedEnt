# Quick Start: Physics Combat System

**TL;DR:** Enemy knockback, attack lunge, and collision detection are now fully operational.

---

## 🚀 5-Minute Test

### 1. Start Local Server
```bash
npm run serve:public
```

### 2. Open Demo
Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/demos/physics-knockback-demo.html`

### 3. Test Features
- Click "Knockback ⬅️ Left" - Player slides left
- Click "Knockback ➡️ Right" - Player slides right
- Click "Heavy 💥 Impact" - Strong knockback with collision bounce
- Watch velocity vectors (red arrows) show real-time physics

### 4. Verify Determinism
- Click "🧪 Test Determinism" button
- Should see: "✅ Physics is deterministic!"

## 📖 Integration Example

### Basic Enemy Knockback (30 seconds)

```javascript
// In your combat system:
function onPlayerAttackHit(enemyIndex, playerX, playerY, enemyX, enemyY) {
    // Calculate direction from player to enemy
    const dx = enemyX - playerX;
    const dy = enemyY - playerY;
    const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    
    if (dist < 0.001) return; // Avoid division by zero
    
    const dirX = dx / dist;
    const dirY = dy / dist;
    
    // Apply knockback
    Module._apply_enemy_knockback(enemyIndex, dirX, dirY, 20.0);
}
```

That's it! Enemy flies backward when hit.

## 🎯 Force Guidelines

| Attack Type | Force Value | Visual Effect |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Light Attack | 15-25 | Small push |
| Heavy Attack | 30-50 | Strong knockback |
| Special Attack | 50-100 | Massive impact |
| Environmental | 10-200 | Variable (wind, explosion) |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "WASM functions not found"
**Solution:** Rebuild WASM:
```bash
npm run wasm:build
```

### "Enemy doesn't move"
**Check:**
1. Did you create the enemy body? `create_enemy_body(index, x, y, mass, radius)`
2. Is the enemy index valid? (0-31)
3. Is the body ID non-zero? (0 = failed creation)

### "Physics feels slow/fast"
**Tune:** Adjust force values in your code. Start with 20.0 and adjust ±10 until it feels right.

## 🎉 What's Working

✅ Enemy knockback (push enemies on hit)  
✅ Attack lunge (dash forward during attacks)  
✅ Collision detection (bodies bounce off each other)  
✅ Deterministic simulation (same input = same output)  
✅ 60 FPS performance (< 1ms physics overhead)  

---

## 🚧 What's Next

### Your First Task
Wire enemy knockback into the main game:

1. Find where player attacks hit enemies
2. Add the code from "Integration Example" above
3. Test in-game
4. Tune force values for feel

### After That
- Add attack lunge to player attacks
- Implement screen shake on heavy hits
- Spawn impact particles
- Add collision-based gameplay (push enemies into walls)

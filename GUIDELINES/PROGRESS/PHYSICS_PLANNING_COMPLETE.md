### ✅ Combat Physics Priority
- **Phase 2:** Entire phase dedicated to physics-driven combat
- **Features:** Momentum damage, impulse knockback, physics hitboxes
- **Code:** 700-line PhysicsCombatSystem replaces CombatManager

### ✅ Enemy Physics Integration

- **Approach:** AI applies forces, not direct control
- **Features:** Ragdoll on death, physics-based attacks

### ✅ Physics-Driven Movement
- **Phase 2:** PlayerManager → PlayerEntity (complete rewrite)
- **Method:** Apply forces for movement, query physics for state
- **Result:** Momentum, sliding, surface friction all physics-based

### ✅ Direct Interaction
- **Phase 4:** Grab, throw, push systems
- **Features:** Pick up objects, throw as projectiles, push heavy objects
- **Demo:** Quick Win #3 (Barrel Throw) proves concept

### ✅ Mobile-First Optimization
- **Strategy:** LOD system, sleep system, spatial partition
- **Target:** 100 objects @ 60fps on mid-tier mobile
- **Config:** Mobile-specific settings from day 1
- **Testing:** Performance validated in Phase 1

### ✅ 100 Simultaneous Objects
- **Architecture:** Spatial hash grid for O(1) broad-phase
- **Systems:** Sleep inactive bodies, LOD distant objects
- **Testing:** Phase 1 deliverable includes 100-object test

### ✅ WASM Binary Size Acceptable
- **Estimate:** +200-300KB for full physics
- **Mitigation:** Code splitting, lazy loading if needed
- **Trade-off:** Accepted for full physics capability

## 🎯 Key Architecture Decisions

### Manager → Entity Refactoring
```
OLD:
PlayerManager (owns position/velocity)
  └─ update() directly modifies x, y

NEW:
PlayerEntity (references physics body)
  └─ update() applies forces to PhysicsManager
      └─ PhysicsManager updates all bodies
          └─ PlayerEntity queries position from physics
```

### Combat Redesign
```
OLD:
Attack → DamageCalculation → Scripted knockback

NEW:
Attack spawns physics hitbox
  → Collision detection
    → Momentum-based damage
      → Physics impulse knockback
        → Realistic reaction
```

### Input Handling
```
OLD:
Input → Directly set velocity

NEW:
Input → Calculate desired force
  → PhysicsManager.apply_force()
    → Physics integration
      → Realistic acceleration
```

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Performance doesn't hit 60fps
- **Mitigation:** LOD/sleep systems from Phase 1
- **Validation:** 100-object test in Phase 1
- **Fallback:** Reduce object count or increase LOD aggressiveness

### Risk: Physics feels bad (floaty/imprecise)
- **Mitigation:** Tunable per-entity parameters
- **Validation:** Playtest after Phase 2
- **Fallback:** Adjust mass/friction/drag values

### Risk: Multiplayer determinism fails
- **Mitigation:** Fixed timestep, seeded RNG, golden replays
- **Validation:** Test from Phase 1
- **Fallback:** Fixed-point math if floating-point drifts

### Risk: Timeline overruns
- **Mitigation:** Phased delivery, MVP first
- **Validation:** Track against phase deliverables
- **Fallback:** Reduce scope (defer Phase 4/5 features)

## 💡 Emergent Gameplay Examples

Your physics-first design will enable:

### 1. Environmental Combat
- Knock enemy into fire hazard → enemy burns
- Freeze water → create ice bridge
- Wind pushes projectiles → curve shots around cover

### 2. Momentum Tactics
- Run at enemy → tackle does more damage
- Slide on ice → high-speed attack
- Heavy character → harder to knockback

### 3. Object Weaponization
- Throw barrel at group → bowling ball effect
- Push boulder downhill → steamroll enemies
- Stack boxes → create cover or climbing path

### 4. Surface Tactics
- Ice → fast escape but less control
- Mud → slow but precise positioning
- Normal → balanced movement

### 5. Force Combinations
- Wind + fire → spread flames to enemies
- Water + ice → freeze water to cross
- Throw object into wind → extra distance

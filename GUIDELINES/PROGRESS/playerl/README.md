## 🎯 What to Build Next (Day 4)

### Files to Create (5-6 hours)

1. **`public/src/vfx/abilities/ability-particles.js`** (400 lines)
   - Particle spawning system
   - Charge particles (orange glow)
   - Impact shockwave (expanding ring)
   - Hit sparks (yellow explosions)

2. **`public/src/vfx/abilities/ability-camera-effects.js`** (250 lines)
   - Camera shake system
   - Zoom effects
   - Effect stacking

3. **`public/src/animation/abilities/ability-animation-base.js`** (200 lines)
   - Base class for ability animations
   - Timing utilities
   - Easing functions

4. **Update `public/src/game/abilities/warden-abilities.js`**
   - Integrate particle system
   - Add camera effects
   - Complete bash animation

### Expected Results

After Day 4:
- ✅ Hold E → orange particles spawn and grow
- ✅ Release E → shockwave expands, screen shakes
- ✅ Camera zooms slightly on impact
- ✅ Sparks fly on enemy hit
- ✅ 60 FPS maintained

## 🎬 Visual Effects Preview

### Charge Animation (Hold E)
```
  ⭕ Orange particles spiral inward
  💛 Glow intensifies (0 → 100%)
  📐 Player leans forward (subtle)
  📷 Camera shakes at max charge
```

### Impact Animation (Release E)
```
  ⭕💥 Shockwave ring expands (60-100px)
  ✨ Yellow sparks explode outward
  📷 Screen shakes (intensity 2-3)
  🔍 Camera zooms 1.0 → 1.2 → 1.0
```

### Hit Effects (Per Enemy)
```
  ✨ Additional sparks at hit location
  📷 Smaller screen shake
  💢 Enemy knockback (WASM handles)
```

## 📐 Technical Specifications

### Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **FPS** | 60 | 30+ |
| **Particle update** | < 0.5ms | < 2ms |
| **Particle render** | < 1ms | < 3ms |
| **Total VFX** | < 2ms | < 5ms |
| **Max particles** | 500 | 1000 |

### Architecture Principles
- ✅ **WASM-First**: All logic in C++
- ✅ **Visual Only**: JS handles rendering
- ✅ **Read-Only**: JS queries WASM state
- ✅ **Deterministic**: Same inputs = same results
- ✅ **Modular**: Max 500 lines per file

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### WASM-First Architecture
```
Player Input → JS (Input Capture)
           ↓
         WASM (All Logic)
           ↓
         JS (Visual Effects)
           ↓
        Canvas (Rendering)
```

### Particle System Flow
```
Spawn Particles → Update Physics → Render to Canvas
     ↓                ↓                    ↓
  Position         Velocity            Transform
  Lifetime         Forces              Draw Calls
  Properties       Collision           Batching
```

### Camera Effect Stack
```
Base Camera → Apply Shake → Apply Zoom → Final Transform
    ↓              ↓             ↓            ↓
Position      +Offset X/Y    *Scale      World→Screen

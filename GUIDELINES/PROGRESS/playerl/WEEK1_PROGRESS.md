# 🛡️ Week 1: Warden Shoulder Bash - Progress Log

## ✅ Day 1: WASM Core Implementation (COMPLETE)

### Files Modified
- ✅ `public/src/wasm/managers/PlayerManager.h`
- ✅ `public/src/wasm/managers/PlayerManager.cpp`

### What Was Added

#### Data Structures
```cpp
struct ShoulderBashState {
    bool is_active = false;
    bool is_charging = false;
    float duration = 0.0f;
    float charge_time = 0.0f;
    float max_charge = 1.0f;
    Fixed force_multiplier;
    uint32_t targets_hit = 0;
};
```

#### Methods Implemented
- ✅ `start_charging_bash()` - Begin charging the bash
- ✅ `update_bash_charge(float dt)` - Update charge level over time
- ✅ `release_bash()` - Execute the bash attack
- ✅ `update_active_bash(float dt)` - Update bash duration
- ✅ `on_bash_hit(uint32_t target_id)` - Handle bash collision
- ✅ `can_bash()` - Check if player can bash
- ✅ `update_facing_direction()` - Track player facing direction

#### Getters
- ✅ `get_bash_charge_level()` - Returns 0-1 charge progress
- ✅ `is_bash_active()` - Returns if bash is executing
- ✅ `is_bash_charging()` - Returns if currently charging
- ✅ `get_bash_targets_hit()` - Returns hit count
- ✅ `get_facing_x/y()` - Returns facing direction

#### Game Balance Constants
```cpp
static constexpr float BASH_MIN_CHARGE = 0.3f;         // 30% minimum
static constexpr float BASH_STAMINA_COST = 0.3f;       // 30% stamina
static constexpr float BASH_DURATION = 0.6f;           // 0.6s active
static constexpr float BASH_BASE_FORCE = 15.0f;        // Base impulse
static constexpr float BASH_CHARGE_SLOW_FACTOR = 0.5f; // 50% speed while charging
static constexpr float BASH_STAMINA_REFUND = 0.1f;     // 10% refund per hit
```

### Build Results

## ✅ Day 2: WASM Exports (COMPLETE)

### Files Modified
- ✅ `public/src/wasm/game_refactored.cpp`

### Exports Added
```cpp
// Bash actions
extern "C" void start_charging_bash();
extern "C" void release_bash();

// Bash state queries
extern "C" float get_bash_charge_level();    // 0.0 - 1.0
extern "C" int is_bash_active();             // 0 or 1
extern "C" int is_bash_charging();           // 0 or 1
extern "C" int get_bash_targets_hit();       // hit count

// Player facing
extern "C" float get_facing_x();             // -1.0 to 1.0
extern "C" float get_facing_y();             // -1.0 to 1.0
```

### Build Results
- ✅ WASM compiles successfully
- ✅ Binary size: 21.4 KB (+0.5 KB)
- ✅ Total exports: 110 functions
- ✅ No linter errors

---

## ✅ Day 3: JavaScript Integration (COMPLETE)

### Files Created
- ✅ `public/src/game/abilities/warden-abilities.js` - Main ability class (230 lines)
- ✅ `public/src/game/abilities/ability-manager.js` - Ability coordinator (67 lines)

### Files Modified
- ✅ `public/src/demo/main.js` - Integrated ability manager into game loop

### Features Implemented
- ✅ `WardenAbilities` class with full WASM integration
- ✅ Bash charge input handling (hold special button)
- ✅ Bash release mechanics (release special button)
- ✅ Charge level tracking and querying
- ✅ WASM state queries (charge level, active status, targets hit)
- ✅ Ability manager coordinator for character-specific abilities
- ✅ Main game loop integration

### Architecture
```javascript
// WASM-First: JS only handles input and visuals
WardenAbilities {
  - startCharging()     // Calls WASM start_charging_bash()
  - releaseBash()       // Calls WASM release_bash()
  - update(dt, input)   // Updates every frame
  - getChargeLevel()    // Query WASM state
  - isActive()          // Query WASM state
}

AbilityManager {
  - Routes to character-specific ability handlers
  - Integrated into main game loop
  - Exposed to window.DZ for debugging
}
```

### Integration Points
1. **Main Game Loop** (`main.js` line ~400):
   - Ability manager updates before WASM update
   - Uses input manager state
   - Respects WASM-first architecture

2. **Input Handling**:
   - Special button triggers bash charge
   - Release triggers bash execution
   - All logic runs in WASM (deterministic)

3. **Debugging**:
   - `window.DZ.abilityManager` exposed
   - Console logging for charge/release events
   - Easy testing in browser console

## 🔄 Next Steps: Day 4-5 (Animation & Testing)

### Day 4: Animation System
1. Create `ability-animations.js` for bash animations
2. Implement charge animation (lean forward, shield up)
3. Add bash execution animation (lunge, impact)
4. Integrate with existing player animation system
5. Add particle effects for charge and impact

### Day 5: Testing & Polish
1. Test bash functionality end-to-end
2. Balance tuning (charge time, force, stamina)
3. Bug fixes and edge cases
4. Documentation and final polish

## 💡 Technical Notes

### WASM-First Architecture ✅
- All bash logic runs in C++ (deterministic)
- JavaScript will only handle:
  - Input capture (special button)
  - Visual effects rendering
  - Animation playback
  - Sound triggers

### Physics Integration (Future)
Currently using simplified velocity application:
```cpp
state_.vel_x += state_.facing_x * bash_force * 0.1f;
state_.vel_y += state_.facing_y * bash_force * 0.1f;
```

**TODO**: Integrate with PhysicsManager for proper impulses:
```cpp
physics_manager->apply_impulse(
    player_body_id,
    FixedVector3(facing_x * bash_force, facing_y * bash_force, Fixed::zero())
);
```

### Collision Detection (Future)
**TODO**: Create bash hitbox and check enemy collisions:
```cpp
// Create capsule hitbox in front of player
// Check overlap with enemy hitboxes
// Call on_bash_hit() for each collision
```

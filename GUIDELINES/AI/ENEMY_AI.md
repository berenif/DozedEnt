## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines the complete enhanced enemy AI system implemented across different enemy types. The system features sophisticated behavioral patterns that create truly challenging and unpredictable encounters, with all logic running in WASM for deterministic multiplayer gameplay.

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- **WASM-First Architecture**: All AI logic runs in WebAssembly for deterministic multiplayer
- **State Machine First**: Clear, minimal states with explicit transitions
- **Attributes Drive Behavior**: Enemy traits (aggression, intelligence, morale, stamina) modulate decision-making
- **Advanced Learning & Memory**: Track player patterns, adapt strategies, predict movements
- **Dynamic Adaptive Difficulty**: Real-time scaling based on observed player skill
- **Environmental Awareness**: Leverage terrain features for tactical positioning
- **Pack Intelligence**: Coordinated hunting strategies with role-based behaviors
- **Emotional States**: Dynamic mood-based behaviors affecting performance

## 🧱 Enhanced State System

The current implementation includes these advanced states:

### Core States
- `Idle` – Passive scanning, stamina recovery, environmental awareness
- `Patrol` – Waypoint movement with terrain evaluation
- `Investigate` – Move toward stimulus with tactical positioning
- `Alert` – Target acquired; evaluate range, terrain, allies, pack coordination
- `Approach` – Close distance using cover/angles, pack formation
- `Strafe` – Maintain optimal range, probe with feints, coordinated attacks
- `Attack` – Execute primary/secondary attacks based on openings and pack timing
- `Combo` – Chained attacks with risk/reward, pack synchronization
- `Retreat` – Disengage to heal, regroup, or bait with pack coordination
- `Recover` – After stagger/whiff; defend or reposition with pack support
- `Flee` – Break contact when morale is low, pack survival priority

### Advanced States (Wolf AI)
- `Ambush` – Coordinated surprise attacks from multiple angles
- `Flank` – Tactical positioning for optimal attack vectors
- `Pack Formation` – Maintain optimal spacing and roles
- `Emotional Response` – Behavior modification based on current emotional state

State transitions are data-driven and respect enemy attributes and emotional states.

## 🧩 Enhanced Role System

The current implementation features dynamic role assignment:

### Core Roles
- `Leader` – Calls synchronized actions, sets focus target, coordinates pack strategy
- `Bruiser` – Pressure and space control, frontline engagement
- `Skirmisher` – Harass, bait, flank, hit-and-run tactics
- `Support` – Debuff, block lines, provide openings, pack healing
- `Scout` – Vision, lure, mark targets, reconnaissance

### Specialized Roles (Wolf AI)
- `Alpha` – Pack leader with unique abilities and commands
- `Beta` – Second-in-command, backup coordination
- `Hunter` – Specialized in tracking and pursuit
- `Ambusher` – Stealth and surprise attack specialist
- `Guardian` – Protective role, defends pack members

### Dynamic Assignment
Roles are assigned based on:
- Current health and stamina levels
- Distance to target and allies
- Line-of-sight and terrain advantages
- Individual attributes (aggression, intelligence, coordination)
- Emotional state and morale
- Pack composition and needs

## 📊 Enhanced Attributes System

The current implementation features comprehensive attribute tracking:

### Core Attributes
- `aggression` (0.3–0.7): Attack frequency, risk tolerance, pack leadership
- `intelligence` (0.4–0.8): Tactics, terrain use, feints, prediction, pack coordination
- `coordination` (0.5–0.8): Team timing, spacing, synchronized attacks
- `morale` (0.6–0.8): Confidence, gates retreat/flee, affects pack behavior
- `stamina` (0–1): Gated actions, recovery windows, pack endurance
- `awareness` (0–1): Perception radius, reaction latency, environmental scanning

### Emotional Attributes
- `confidence` (0–1): Affects decision-making and risk-taking
- `fear` (0–1): Influences retreat behavior and pack cohesion
- `frustration` (0–1): Increases aggression but reduces coordination
- `desperation` (0–1): Triggers high-risk, high-reward behaviors

### Adaptive Scaling
Attributes are dynamically adjusted based on:
- Player skill estimation (speed, reaction time, combat effectiveness)
- Pack performance and success rate
- Environmental conditions and terrain advantages
- Individual health and fatigue levels
- Recent combat outcomes and damage exchanges

## 🧠 Memory & Learning

Track compact, actionable signals:

- Player dodge timing and direction tendencies.
- Block/parry frequency and last timestamps.
- Preferred attack angles that landed.
- Player reaction time approximation.
- Recent damage exchanges (win/lose momentum).

Use rolling windows with decay to avoid overfitting. Update on significant events, not every frame.

## 📈 Adaptive Difficulty

Continuously estimate player skill (e.g., damage taken vs dealt, dodge rate, perfect-block rate, encounter time). Every N seconds:

- Adjust movement speed, attack cadence, feint chance, and reaction delays.
- Interpolate changes smoothly (e.g., 10% toward target per update).
- Respect per-enemy clamps to preserve identity.

Example target ranges:
- speed: 0.85×–1.15×
- aggression: 0.3–0.85
- reactionDelay: 90–220 ms

## 🌲 Terrain & Positioning

Define terrain features at runtime or bake-time:

- `HighGround`, `Cover`, `OpenField`, `Chokepoint`, `LowGround`, `Water` (extendable).

Behaviors:
- Prefer cover when approaching; avoid open field under low morale.
- Seek chokepoints for defense; take high ground for ranged.
- Re-evaluate preferred position when state changes or advantage falls below a threshold.

## 🗣️ Communication (Groups)

Support lightweight messages with range limits:

- `AttackNow`, `Retreat`, `TargetSpotted`, `NeedHelp`, `FlankLeft`, `Regroup`.
- Leaders can trigger synchronized windows (e.g., when ≥ K allies are ready).
- Receivers validate context before acting to avoid thrash.

## 💻 Reference Structures (Language-agnostic)

```cpp
// Emotional/morale states
enum class Emotion : unsigned char { Calm, Aggressive, Fearful, Desperate, Confident, Frustrated };

// Lightweight memory signals
struct EnemyMemory {
    float playerSpeed;
    float playerReactionTime;
    float successfulAttackAngle;
    int dodgePatternId;
    float lastPlayerBlockTime;
    float lastPlayerRollTime;
};

// Terrain feature
enum class TerrainType : unsigned char { HighGround, Cover, OpenField, Chokepoint, LowGround, Water };

struct TerrainFeature { float x, y, radius; TerrainType type; float advantage; };
```

## 🧮 Decision Loops

- Per-frame: perception, light filtering, local movement.
- Every tick (e.g., 100–200 ms): state evaluation, target selection, terrain scan if needed.
- Every N seconds: adaptive difficulty update, role reassignment (groups).

Prefer event-driven updates for costly work (e.g., on damage, on block, on ally signal).

## 🎮 Tuning Guidelines

- Keep transitions readable and testable; avoid hidden side-effects.
- Use cool-downs for expensive actions (feints, big attacks, scans).
- Gate risky choices by morale and stamina.
- Randomize within tight bounds to avoid predictability.

## 🚀 Performance

- Use fixed-size buffers and object pools.
- O(n) per-enemy logic; cap group coordination to nearby allies.
- Cache line-of-sight and terrain queries; stagger expensive scans.

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

## 🔮 Extension Ideas

- Seasonal or biome behaviors; weather and day/night modifiers.
- Injury and impairment effects (limp, reduced accuracy).
- Boss phases with emotion-driven move sets.

## Overview

**Emergent gameplay** refers to complex, interesting behaviors that arise from the interaction of simple game systems. DozedEnt's physics, combat, and AI systems are designed to create rich emergent experiences that players discover organically.

### Design Philosophy
- **Simple Rules, Complex Outcomes:** Each system is straightforward but their interactions create depth
- **Player Creativity:** Systems enable rather than prescribe strategies
- **Unplanned Discovery:** Best moments are ones we didn't explicitly design
- **Rewarding Mastery:** Skill and experimentation pay off

---

## Physics-Driven Emergent Gameplay

### 1. **The Barrel Cannon**

**Discovery:**
Players realized throwing barrels can knock back enemies, and those enemies can collide with other enemies.

**Setup:**
```javascript
// Spawn barrel
exports.spawn_barrel(playerX, playerY);

// Throw at enemy cluster
const throwDir = calculateDirection(playerPos, enemyCluster);
exports.throw_barrel(0, throwDir.x * 30.0, throwDir.y * 20.0);
```

**Emergence:**
- Barrel hits first enemy â†’ knockback applied
- First enemy flies backward â†’ collides with second enemy
- Chain reaction creates multi-enemy knockback
- Single barrel can disable entire pack

**Skill Expression:**
- Angle prediction for maximum hits
- Timing throw during enemy approach
- Using environmental walls to ricochet

---

### 2. **The Knockback Ping-Pong**

**Discovery:**
Two players can knock an enemy back and forth between them, preventing it from acting.

**Setup:**
```javascript
// Player 1 attacks from left
exports.handle_incoming_attack(25, playerX - 0.1, playerY);

// Enemy flies right toward Player 2
// Player 2 attacks from right
exports.handle_incoming_attack(25, playerX + 0.1, playerY);

// Enemy flies back left
```

**Emergence:**
- Enemy is perpetually airborne/stunned
- Requires coordination between players
- Enemy AI can't execute attacks while in knockback
- Multiplayer "juggling" mini-game

**Counter-Play:**
- Enemy pack splits players to prevent setup
- Alpha wolf flanks during juggle
- Timeout: diminishing knockback after 3 hits

---

### 3. **Environmental Ricochet**

**Discovery:**
Knockback into walls causes secondary bounce, extending knockback distance.

**Physics:**
```cpp
// Collision with wall
if (body.position.x < 0.0f || body.position.x > 1.0f) {
    body.velocity.x *= -body.restitution; // Bounce
}
```

**Emergence:**
- Enemy knocked into wall bounces back
- Can bounce into other enemies
- Corner knockbacks trap enemies
- "Pinball" combat strategy

**Tactics:**
- Position fights near walls
- Angle attacks for corner traps
- Chain bounces for multi-hit combos

---

### 4. **The Physics Save**

**Discovery:**
Knockback can push players out of hazard zones.

**Scenario:**
- Player standing in fire/poison area
- Enemy attack knocks player backward
- Player exits hazard zone before tick damage
- "Enemy saved my life"

**Emergence:**
- Negative (attack) creates positive (hazard escape)
- Counterintuitive survival strategy
- Players intentionally bait attacks near hazards
- High-risk, high-skill play

---

## Combat Emergence

### 5. **Parry-Into-Counter-Chain**

**Discovery:**
Perfect parry staggers enemy â†’ follow-up attack staggers other enemies â†’ chain continues.

**Sequence:**
```javascript
// Enemy attacks
exports.handle_incoming_attack(20, enemyX, enemyY);

// Perfect parry timing
if (inParryWindow) {
  exports.on_parry();
  
  // Enemy is stunned
  // Player counterattacks with heavy
  exports.on_heavy_attack();
  
  // Heavy knockback hits nearby enemy
  // New enemy is now open for parry
}
```

**Emergence:**
- One perfect parry enables multi-enemy combo
- Skill-based crowd control
- High risk (miss timing = take damage)
- Flow state "rhythm game" feel

**Mastery:**
- 360-degree awareness
- Attack timing prediction
- Positioning for maximum chain length

---

### 6. **Stamina Gambling**

**Discovery:**
Empty stamina prevents roll but enables risky hyperarmor play.

**Mechanic:**
```javascript
const stamina = exports.get_stamina();

if (stamina < 0.2) {
  // Can't dodge
  // Can't run
  // But heavy attacks gain hyperarmor (can't be interrupted)
  
  exports.on_heavy_attack(); // Commit to trade
}
```

**Emergence:**
- Low stamina isn't pure penalty
- High-damage "all-in" strategy
- Risk/reward decision-making
- Different from standard "manage resource" gameplay

**Tactics:**
- Intentionally drain stamina before boss
- Trade damage with low-HP enemies
- Bait enemy into thinking player is vulnerable

---

### 7. **The Feint Bait**

**Discovery:**
Start heavy attack â†’ enemy begins parry â†’ feint cancel â†’ punish parry recovery.

**Execution:**
```javascript
// Start heavy attack
exports.on_heavy_attack();

// Enemy sees windup, starts parrying
// Player cancels with roll
if (exports.can_feint_heavy()) {
  exports.on_roll_start();
}

// Enemy parry misses (nothing to parry)
// Enemy in recovery animation
// Player punishes with light attack
exports.on_light_attack();
```

**Emergence:**
- Mind games at high level
- Punishes defensive play
- Mix-up game emerges
- Creates PvE "fighting game" feel

**Counter-Play:**
- AI learns to delay parry
- AI uses feints against player
- Adaptive difficulty increases mind game depth

---

## Enemy AI Emergence

### 8. **Pack Pincer Formation**

**Discovery:**
When player focuses on Alpha, Betas flank automatically.

**AI Logic:**
```cpp
if (role == ALPHA) {
    // Attack from front
    approach_direct(player_pos);
}

if (role == BETA && alpha_is_engaging) {
    // Flank from sides
    approach_flanking(player_pos, alpha_pos);
}
```

**Emergence:**
- Player surrounded without explicit "surround" behavior
- Natural from simple role-based rules
- Forces player movement
- Terrain-aware (uses obstacles to complete pincer)

**Tactics:**
- Kill Betas first to prevent flank
- Use terrain to block one flank
- Kite in circles to prevent setup

---

### 9. **Fear Chain Reaction**

**Discovery:**
Kill one enemy â†’ nearby enemies gain fear â†’ flee â†’ player chases â†’ other enemies regroup.

**AI States:**
```cpp
if (nearby_ally_died && health < 0.5f) {
    state = FLEE;
}

if (fleeing && distance_from_player > 0.4f) {
    state = REGROUP;
}
```

**Emergence:**
- Dynamic battlefield control zones
- Prey/predator role reversal
- Player must choose: chase or defend position
- Natural ebb and flow to combat

**Exploitation:**
- Execute weak enemies to trigger mass flee
- Split pack with fear tactics
- Control space without direct combat

---

### 10. **Adaptive Difficulty Spiral**

**Discovery:**
Player gets good â†’ AI gets harder â†’ player adapts â†’ creates skill plateau â†’ AI backs off.

**System:**
```cpp
if (player_win_streak > 3) {
    wolf_speed *= 1.1f;
    wolf_aggression += 0.1f;
}

if (player_loss_streak > 2) {
    wolf_speed *= 0.9f;
    wolf_aggression -= 0.1f;
}
```

**Emergence:**
- Game "breathes" with player skill
- No explicit difficulty slider needed
- Always challenging but fair
- Smooth learning curve

**Experience:**
- New players: forgiving, builds confidence
- Skilled players: constant challenge
- Prevents boredom or frustration extremes

---

## Environmental Emergence

### 11. **Weather Warfare**

**Discovery:**
Wind zones push enemies and projectiles, creating asymmetric battles.

**Setup:**
```javascript
// Set wind blowing left
exports.set_weather_wind(-0.5, 0.0);

// Player attacks from upwind (right)
// Attacks travel faster with wind
// Enemies approach slower against wind
```

**Emergence:**
- Positional advantage from terrain
- Environmental strategy layer
- Dynamic battlefields
- Forces player to adapt positioning

**Tactics:**
- Control high ground (upwind)
- Kite enemies into headwind
- Use tailwind for retreats

---

### 12. **Hazard Herding**

**Discovery:**
Knock enemies into hazards for damage-over-time without spending resources.

**Scenario:**
```javascript
// Fire hazard at (0.7, 0.5)
const hazardX = 0.7;
const hazardY = 0.5;

// Enemy at (0.6, 0.5)
// Knockback toward hazard
exports.apply_enemy_knockback(
  enemyIndex,
  0.3, // Push right
  0.0
);

// Enemy enters fire â†’ burning DOT applied
```

**Emergence:**
- Environment as weapon
- Resource-free damage
- Strategic positioning matters
- Hazards aren't just obstacles

**Mastery:**
- Memorize hazard positions
- Calculate knockback vectors
- Chain enemies through multiple hazards

---

## Class Ability Synergies

### 13. **Warden Bash + Raider Charge = The Hammer and Anvil**

**Combo:**
- Warden charges Bash (creates immovable hitbox)
- Raider uses Berserker Charge (pushes enemies)
- Enemies knocked into Bash hitbox
- Double damage from both abilities

**Emergence:**
- Neither class designed for this specifically
- Natural synergy from physics
- Requires coordination
- Rewards teamwork

---

### 14. **Kensei Dash + Warden Block = The Bait and Punish**

**Combo:**
- Warden blocks in front of pack
- Wolves commit to attacks
- Kensei dashes through pack during attack animations
- Wolves vulnerable during recovery
- Kensei scores free backstabs

**Emergence:**
- One player tanks, one flanks
- Exploits enemy attack commitment
- Timing-based synergy
- High skill ceiling

---

### 15. **Triple Bash Launch**

**Discovery:**
Three Wardens can stack bash hitboxes to launch enemy across screen.

**Execution:**
```javascript
// All three Wardens charge bash
warden1.start_charging_bash();
warden2.start_charging_bash();
warden3.start_charging_bash();

// Release simultaneously at enemy
warden1.release_bash();
warden2.release_bash();
warden3.release_bash();

// Knockback forces stack
// Enemy receives ~60 force units
// Flies across entire screen
```

**Emergence:**
- Absurd but fun interaction
- Requires perfect timing
- Creates highlight moments
- Unintended but embraced

---

## Multiplayer Emergence

### 16. **Body Blocking**

**Discovery:**
Player collision prevents enemy movement, enabling "tanking" strategy.

**Tactic:**
- Tank player stands in doorway/chokepoint
- Enemies can't path around (collision prevents)
- Ranged players attack from behind tank
- Classic MMO strategy emerges naturally

**Physics:**
```cpp
// Player-enemy collision
if (dist < player_radius + enemy_radius) {
    // Push apart
    apply_separation_force(player, enemy);
    
    // But if player has hyperarmor...
    if (player_has_hyperarmor) {
        enemy_velocity = 0; // Immovable wall
    }
}
```

---

### 17. **Coordinated Knockback Chains**

**Discovery:**
Players alternate attacks to keep enemy airborne indefinitely.

**Pattern:**
1. Player A attacks â†’ Enemy knocked to Player B
2. Player B attacks â†’ Enemy knocked back to Player A
3. Repeat until enemy dead
4. Enemy never touches ground

**Counter:**
- Diminishing returns on knockback (planned)
- Enemy hyperarmor after N hits
- Pack interference

---

### 18. **Ability Cooldown Rotation**

**Discovery:**
Classes with same ability stagger cooldowns for 100% uptime.

**Example (Kensei Dash):**
- Kensei 1 dashes at 0s (invulnerable for 0.5s)
- Kensei 2 dashes at 0.5s
- Kensei 3 dashes at 1.0s
- Effective permanent invulnerability with coordination

**Emergence:**
- Unintended but requires high coordination
- Balancing challenge (planned nerf)
- Rewarding for skilled teams

---

## Player-Discovered Tactics

### 19. **The Dodge-Cancel Attack Buffer**

**Discovery:**
Start attack â†’ dodge during windup â†’ attack executes after dodge.

**Exploit:**
```javascript
// Start heavy attack
exports.on_heavy_attack();

// Enemy attacks during windup
// Player dodges (gains i-frames)
exports.on_roll_start();

// Heavy attack still executes after roll
// Player got safety + damage
```

**Status:**
- **Unintended** but interesting
- Kept as high-skill technique
- Requires precise timing
- Adds depth to combat

---

### 20. **Stamina-Free Rolling**

**Discovery:**
Roll at exact moment stamina fully depletes grants free dodge.

**Timing:**
```javascript
const stamina = exports.get_stamina();

if (stamina > 0.0 && stamina < 0.05) {
  // Roll before stamina hits zero
  exports.on_roll_start();
  
  // Stamina reaches zero during roll
  // Roll completes anyway
  // No stamina cost!
}
```

**Status:**
- **Bug** technically
- So difficult to execute consistently it's kept
- Rewards frame-perfect play
- "Happy accident"

---

## Design Principles for Emergence

### How to Foster Emergence

1. **Simple, Consistent Rules:**
   - Physics always applies
   - Knockback always works
   - No special cases

2. **System Interactions:**
   - Combat + Physics
   - AI + Environment
   - Abilities + Hazards

3. **Player Agency:**
   - Let players experiment
   - Don't punish creativity
   - Reward mastery

4. **Unbalanced is OK (Sometimes):**
   - Barrel chain reactions are OP â†’ kept because fun
   - Bash stacking is silly â†’ kept because rare/coordinated
   - Frame-perfect techs â†’ gatekeep skill ceiling

5. **Embrace Accidents:**
   - Some best features were bugs
   - Test, observe, decide
   - Balance > "intended design"

---

## Future Emergence Opportunities

### Planned Systems

**Force Fields:**
- Wind tunnels + knockback = amplified launches
- Gravity wells + dash = momentum preservation
- Repulsion fields + melee = ranged melee attacks

**Environmental Destruction:**
- Break wall â†’ new pathfinding routes
- Destroy cover â†’ tactical disadvantage
- Rubble as projectiles

**Advanced AI Behaviors:**
- Wolves learn player tactics
- Counter-strategies emerge
- AI uses player tactics against them

**Procedural Abilities:**
- Ability modifiers create unique combinations
- "Bash + Fire Damage" â‰  designed interaction
- Thousands of emergent ability builds

## Conclusion

Emergent gameplay is the heart of DozedEnt's depth. By creating simple, consistent systems that interact meaningfully, we enable players to discover tactics, strategies, and moments we never explicitly designed.

**Core Takeaway:** The best gameplay is discovered, not prescribed.

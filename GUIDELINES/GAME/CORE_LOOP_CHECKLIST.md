## Core loop feature checklist

Use this template every time you add or change a feature that touches the loop: Explore â†’ Fight â†’ Choose â†’ PowerUp â†’ Risk â†’ Escalate â†’ CashOut â†’ Reset.

Duplicate the blocks below for each feature and check items off before merging.

### Feature summary
- **Name**: _e.g., Dash i-frame tuning_
- **Target phase(s)**: _Explore/Fight/Choose/..._
- **Seeds tested**: _e.g., 12345, 67890_
- **Owner/Date**: _who, when_

### Universal (must pass for every feature)
- [ ] Logic is entirely in WASM (C++); JS only forwards inputs/renders UI
- [ ] Deterministic with identical seed + input script (golden run matches)
- [x] RNG uses WASM substream; no `Math.random` in JS
- [ ] API surface minimal: exports only flat getters/setters; no JSON
- [ ] Snapshots remain compact/flat; no perf regressions in frame time
- [ ] Build succeeds and `public/game.wasm` updated
- [ ] Docs updated (`AGENTS.md` and this checklist entry)
- [ ] Balance JSON changes reflected in `src/wasm/generated/balance_data.h`
- [ ] Golden tests re-run after balance tuning

### Explore
- [ ] Room geometry/hazards resolved in WASM, deterministic per seed
- [ ] Landmarks/exits exposed via snapshot for UI only

### Fight
- [ ] Movement, stamina, i-frames/guard resolved in WASM
- [ ] Telegraph timings and cancel windows are data-driven in WASM
- [ ] Block/parry results come from `handle_incoming_attack` only

### Choose
- [x] Choice generation in WASM respects pools/exclusions/pity timers
- [ ] Three options follow shape: Safe / Spicy / Weird
- [ ] UI reads via `get_choice_*` and commits with `commit_choice(id)`

### PowerUp
- [ ] Boon/relic/affix effects applied in WASM on `commit_choice`
- [ ] Immediate breakpoint or visible stat change reflected in snapshot

### ðŸŽ² Phase: Risk (Push Your Luck)
- [ ] **Curse System** - Negative effects managed in WASM
- [ ] **Elite Encounters** - Special enemy flags set deterministically
- [ ] **Timed Events** - Countdown mechanics in WASM
- [ ] **Risk/Reward Balance** - Clear cost/benefit ratios
- [ ] **Escape Mechanism** - Bail-out option always available
- [ ] **Probability Curves** - Risk increases properly scaled

### ðŸ“ˆ Phase: Escalate
- [ ] **Difficulty Scaling** - Enemy density increases properly
- [ ] **Modifier System** - Environmental challenges added
- [ ] **Miniboss Spawns** - Interrupt events deterministic
- [ ] **Mechanical Complexity** - New problems, not just stat inflation
- [ ] **Data-Driven Design** - Uses tags/systems over hardcoded values
- [ ] **Player Adaptation** - Forces strategy changes

### ðŸ’° Phase: CashOut
- [ ] **Shop System** - Item availability/pricing in WASM
- [ ] **Forge Mechanics** - Upgrade paths calculated server-side
- [ ] **Healing Options** - Recovery amounts determined in WASM
- [ ] **Currency Management** - Dual-currency system enforced:
  - ðŸ”¶ **Primary Currency** - Main resource
  - ðŸ”· **Premium Currency** - Special resource
- [ ] **Transaction Validation** - All purchases verified in WASM

### Reset
- [ ] Instant restart via `reset_run(seed)` reproduces clean state
- [x] Early rooms short to regain flow; spawn logic deterministic

### Testing & verification
- [ ] Golden test: 60s input script produces identical end-state
- [ ] Pity timer test: forced bad streak flips to a guarantee
- [ ] Performance: no GC churn/regressions; memory stays within limits

#### Follow-ups
- Replace JS `Math.random` seeding in `restartRun` with deterministic/explicit seed handling
- Move simulation time to WASM and pass sim time (not wall-clock) to `set_blocking`/`handle_incoming_attack`
- Expose landmarks/exits via WASM snapshot getters; JS only renders
- âœ… Implement choice pools/exclusions/pity timers in WASM
- Externalize telegraph/cancel timings as data in WASM
- âœ… Add Risk/Escalate/CashOut scaffolding and exports in WASM
- Move spawn selection into WASM; UI reads spawn from snapshot
- âœ… Add golden replay test and perf budget checks
- âœ… Ensure build step runs and updates `public/game.wasm`

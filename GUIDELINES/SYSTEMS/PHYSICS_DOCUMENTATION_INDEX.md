## üí° Key Insights

### Why Physics-First?
1. **Emergent gameplay** - Simple rules create complex scenarios
2. **Consistency** - All systems use same physics foundation
3. **Performance** - Optimized for mobile-first
4. **Multiplayer** - Deterministic simulation for sync

### Why Complete Overhaul?
1. **Current code not physics-aware** - Direct position updates
2. **Managers don't integrate** - No unified physics
3. **Combat is scripted** - Not momentum-based
4. **No environmental interaction** - Can't grab/throw objects

### Why This Approach?
1. **Phased rollout** - Incremental, testable milestones
2. **Quick wins early** - Prove concept in week 1-2
3. **Clear dependencies** - Know what builds on what
4. **Risk mitigation** - Performance/determinism validated early

## üìû Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Can we do this incrementally without full refactor?**  
A: No. Current code directly manipulates position, incompatible with physics-first. Need clean separation.

**Q: Why 10 weeks? Can we go faster?**  
A: 5,400 lines of new code + 1,200 lines refactored + testing. 2 engineers could parallelize to 6-7 weeks.

**Q: What if performance doesn't hit 60fps?**  
A: LOD system, sleep system, and spatial partition designed for this. Quick Win #1 validates performance early.

**Q: How do we maintain existing gameplay feel?**  
A: Tunable parameters (mass, friction, drag) per entity type. Playtest and adjust.

**Q: What about multiplayer determinism?**  
A: Fixed timestep, seeded RNG, golden replays. Tested from Phase 1.
